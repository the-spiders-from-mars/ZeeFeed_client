According to research conducted by the Small Business Administration (SBA), one of the reasons 22% of start-ups fail within the first five years of launching is due to poor management.<sup id=\"footnote_plugin_tooltip_7735_1\" class=\"footnote_plugin_tooltip_text\" onclick=\"footnote_moveToAnchor('footnote_plugin_reference_7735_1');\">[1]</sup><span class=\"footnote_tooltip\" id=\"footnote_plugin_tooltip_text_7735_1\"></span></p>\n<p>While there are many management skills for us to acquire, the ability to foresee the future is unquestionably the number one ability everyone longs to possess. Fortunately, it&rsquo;s not some inherent talent only available to an elite few. With the right tools and resources, you too can make accurate business projections.</p>\n<h2>What Is PEST Analysis and How It Can Help You Predict the Future</h2>\n<p>One of the best tools to use is the PEST analysis. A PEST analysis is centered around the political, economic, social and technological factors of a business. These are part of the macro environment. The macro environment is about external influences and factors that can heavily influence a business whether they choose it or not. We will break down the PEST analysis into 4 major factors so you have a better understanding before applying it to your business:</p>\n<h3>Political Factor</h3>\n<p><strong>What it means:</strong> This is about regulations and laws that are put in place in your place of residence/ town/ country that have a significant on your business. The issues around politics are, tax, political stability, trade regulations, affirmative actions and so forth.</p>\n<p><strong>Why it is important:</strong> This is important when planning your finances, hiring policies and training of staff. Some companies have quotas around hiring minorities and previously disadvantaged groups. Some industries require you to train staff on first aid and healthy safety.</p>\n<p><strong>How to use it:</strong> When you are planning the overall growth it&rsquo;s important to keep in mind what these requirements are when you reach a certain turnover or head count of staff. This puts you ahead of the curve and you have no surprises when you do reach a certain threshold as implementation and planning can be very costly.</p>\n<h3>Economic Factor</h3>\n<p><strong>What it means:</strong> This include factors such as inflation, currency strength, interest rates, trading power and foreign investments to name a few.</p>\n<p><strong>Why it is important:</strong> This helps if you want to get funding for your business, financing, loans from the banks. The economic environment also gives you insight regarding un-employment rates, pay rates and other financial aspect re your business.</p>\n<p><strong>How to use it: </strong>This is great for when you&rsquo;re making financial projections. For example, if you have a long term loan out against your company, factoring in interest rates of the bank ensures that you do not come short on your budgeting. If you wish to hire someone with certain experience and expertise, knowing what the market rate is for such professional can help you in terms of your hiring plan and how to factor in that salary when you&rsquo;re budgeting</p>\n<h3>Social Factor</h3>\n<p><strong>What it means:</strong> The social environment deals with demographics, location, culture, lifestyle and the likes. Having a know how about your environment is paramount to how you establish your business. For example, there is not use going to sell feminine products in an industrial area dominated by men. Or selling fur coats in a place where animal rights are of high importance to the culture. Different cultures like different things so you need to know how to accommodate them.</p>\n<p><strong>Why it is important:</strong> When the community feel that the business caters to their needs and understands them, you gain more loyal customers and that gives you competitive advantage.</p>\n<p><strong>How to use it:</strong> It is also very important for organizations to be involved in Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) &ndash; most people think CSR is expensive and is only applicable to big corporations but it&rsquo;s a social responsibility every company has. You can choose to devote your time to helping repair roofs in a school. You can get employees involved in helping at charities or you can give contribution to a cause. It doesn&rsquo;t have to be millions but the little can go a long way.</p>\n<h3>Technological Factor</h3>\n<p><strong>What it means:</strong> The technological aspect of the PEST is something that is new to this analysis. But in today&rsquo;s world, it is almost detrimental to your business to ignore technology.</p>\n<p><strong>Why it is important:</strong> How does technology affect the business you do? The world of retail was transformed significantly when e-commerce was introduced. If your organization deals with everyday mundane and monotonous tasks, how does technology affect your growth. There are some systems that are automated to help eradicate the human error. There are computers that can do a job that easily required 4 people.</p>\n<p><strong>How to use it:</strong> Knowing what kind of technology is out there and how it either threatens/assists your business, will help you derive a better vision and makes your more flexible and you won&rsquo;t be so susceptible to change.</p>\n<p>The PEST analysis can also be extended to a PESTEL Analysis, which deals with the environment issues like animal rights, carbon footprints, pollution and the likes as well as legal matters such as discriminations laws, harassment, minimum wages and other compliance issues.</p>\n<p>If you have the desire to grow and expand your business to be sustainable, the PEST analysis is a tool that can best give you a guideline to take the necessary steps.</p><div class=\"footnote_container_prepare\">\t<h2>Reference</h2></div><div id=\"footnote_references_container\" style=\"\">\t<table class=\"footnote-reference-container\">\t\t<tbody>\t\t<tr>\t<td class=\"footnote_plugin_index\"><span id=\"footnote_plugin_reference_7735_1\">[1]</span></td>\t<td class=\"footnote_plugin_link\"><span onclick=\"footnote_moveToAnchor('footnote_plugin_tooltip_7735_1');\">^</span></td>\t<td class=\"footnote_plugin_text\">Office of Advocacy: <a href=\"https://www.sba.gov/sites/default/files/advocacy/SB-FAQ-2016_WEB.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">Frequently Asked Questions</a></td></tr>\t\t</tbody>\t</table></div><script type=\"text/javascript\">\tfunction footnote_expand_reference_container() {\t\tjQuery(\"#footnote_references_container\").show();        jQuery(\"#footnote_reference_container_collapse_button\").text(\"-\");\t}    function footnote_collapse_reference_container() {        jQuery(\"#footnote_references_container\").hide();        jQuery(\"#footnote_reference_container_collapse_button\").text(\"+\");    }\tfunction footnote_expand_collapse_reference_container() {\t\tif (jQuery(\"#footnote_references_container\").is(\":hidden\")) {            footnote_expand_reference_container();\t\t} else {            footnote_collapse_reference_container();\t\t}\t}    function footnote_moveToAnchor(p_str_TargetID) {        footnote_expand_reference_container();        var l_obj_Target = jQuery(\"#\" + p_str_TargetID);        if(l_obj_Target.length) {            jQuery('html, body').animate({                scrollTop: l_obj_Target.offset().top - window.innerHeight/2            }, 1000);        }    }</script><p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.lifehack.org/587338/pest-analysis\">Successful Businesses Use This Tool to Predict the Future and Get Ahead of Their Competitors</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.lifehack.org\">Lifehack</a>.</p>",

You have a business meeting coming up in a few days, week or months and you are wandering through the internet looking for some suggestions and ideas to make it go smooth.<sup id=\"footnote_plugin_tooltip_3262_1\" class=\"footnote_plugin_tooltip_text\" onclick=\"footnote_moveToAnchor('footnote_plugin_reference_3262_1');\">[1]</sup><span class=\"footnote_tooltip\" id=\"footnote_plugin_tooltip_text_3262_1\"></span> Well, you are not alone.</p>\n<p>We have done this too at some point before our meetings, and we know what it is like to burn your eyes reading through the uncountable number of business articles to find the one that sounds worth trying. We understand how much of a painful drag it is to read through the never-ending pieces of writing, so we decided to help you by putting together some of the most effective advice that you must try to make sure that your business meeting goes well.</p>\n<h2>Have the Meeting in a Familiar Place to Boost Your Confidence</h2>\n<p>The place that you are familiar with will always serve as the best region for your performance that you put up in a meeting. Whenever given a chance to decide where the meeting should be held, go for your own office&rsquo;s conference room. If you are into sports, you would know that a team always does well on its home ground and business meetings follow a similar trend too. You become more confident when you are in a familiar place, and you can utilise this confidence to a good effect.</p>\n<h2>Give a Professional Presentation to Win Your Clint&rsquo;s Trust</h2>\n<p>Presentations speak for what you offer, so always make them look professional. It doesn&rsquo;t matter what you are offering. What is more important is how well you put up that offer in your PPTs and how you deliver the message with certainty. Doing this will make your client believe that you are specialized in your area of working, and it will be beneficial for you to achieve your target in the meetings.</p>\n<h2>Don&rsquo;t Keep Talking About the Future Plan, Highlight Your Achievements Occasionally</h2>\n<p>In the off-meeting conversations and during the meetings make sure that you slip in the results of your company so that your clients can trust your work. Not only the presentations, when you create a website of your services or product let there be a section that highlights the achievements of your work because your clients will always check it before attending a meeting with you. In the meetings, show your previous works that are relevant to that of asked by your clients so that they can know what your capabilities are.</p>\n<h2>Know Your Audience Well so You Can Satisfy Their Expectations</h2>\n<p>Conducting a meeting is like performing on a stage, and the clients are your audience. Know what your audience (or clients) like. Some clients may be into the plain old textual type of presentations while some clients may expect more of the visuals and samples in the meeting. Make sure that you give your clients exactly what they want. A common mistake that rookies make during the presentations is to lose the track while trying to make it look impressive. Do understand that, while trying to impress is not a bad idea at all, but your clients would not appreciate it if they find no relevance of their work in the presentation you put up.</p>\n<p>Knowing your clients in advance will also help you to be confident in front of them,<sup id=\"footnote_plugin_tooltip_3262_2\" class=\"footnote_plugin_tooltip_text\" onclick=\"footnote_moveToAnchor('footnote_plugin_reference_3262_2');\">[2]</sup><span class=\"footnote_tooltip\" id=\"footnote_plugin_tooltip_text_3262_2\"></span> and you can probably expect what kind of questions might come from them based on their concerns about your services or the products you offer.</p>\n<h2>Dress Smart and Look Smart to Display Your Confidence</h2>\n<p>We can&rsquo;t fall short of words to tell you how important your appearance is in a business meeting. Forget the business meeting; appearance is important everywhere. Consciously or not, we have a tendency to judge people by how they carry themselves in front of us. You do not have to overdo it, just keep it simple. Make sure that you do not compromise your comfort to look good; there is always a right balance for it. Wear the colors that suit you the best. Based on the type of meeting, wear the right kind of dress that make you look professional.</p>\n<p>Clothes are not the only things that will make you look good. Carry a confident smile with you throughout the presentation and also watch out for the gestures you make, how you sit and all the postures of yours.</p>\n<p>Make the meeting your stage to perform and be the show-stopper on the day of the meeting. There are a lot of things apart from the product you offer that decides the fate of the deal you are there for as we mentioned above. Increase the chances of sealing the deal that you wish for by performing well in these kinds of meetings by using the advice that we have referred to above.</p><div class=\"footnote_container_prepare\">\t<h2>Reference</h2></div><div id=\"footnote_references_container\" style=\"\">\t<table class=\"footnote-reference-container\">\t\t<tbody>\t\t<tr>\t<td class=\"footnote_plugin_index\"><span id=\"footnote_plugin_reference_3262_1\">[1]</span></td>\t<td class=\"footnote_plugin_link\"><span onclick=\"footnote_moveToAnchor('footnote_plugin_tooltip_3262_1');\">^</span></td>\t<td class=\"footnote_plugin_text\">Lifehack: <a href=\"http://www.lifehack.org/487903/6-hacks-to-make-your-business-meetings-more-efficient\">6 Hacks to Make your Business Meetings More Efficient</a></td></tr><tr>\t<td class=\"footnote_plugin_index\"><span id=\"footnote_plugin_reference_3262_2\">[2]</span></td>\t<td class=\"footnote_plugin_link\"><span onclick=\"footnote_moveToAnchor('footnote_plugin_tooltip_3262_2');\">^</span></td>\t<td class=\"footnote_plugin_text\">Lifehack: <a href=\"http://www.lifehack.org/articles/communication/10-ways-you-can-build-self-confidence-instantly.html\">10 Ways You Can Do To Build Self Confidence Instantly</a></td></tr>\t\t</tbody>\t</table></div><script type=\"text/javascript\">\tfunction footnote_expand_reference_container() {\t\tjQuery(\"#footnote_references_container\").show();        jQuery(\"#footnote_reference_container_collapse_button\").text(\"-\");\t}    function footnote_collapse_reference_container() {        jQuery(\"#footnote_references_container\").hide();        jQuery(\"#footnote_reference_container_collapse_button\").text(\"+\");    }\tfunction footnote_expand_collapse_reference_container() {\t\tif (jQuery(\"#footnote_references_container\").is(\":hidden\")) {            footnote_expand_reference_container();\t\t} else {            footnote_collapse_reference_container();\t\t}\t}    function footnote_moveToAnchor(p_str_TargetID) {        footnote_expand_reference_container();        var l_obj_Target = jQuery(\"#\" + p_str_TargetID);        if(l_obj_Target.length) {            jQuery('html, body').animate({                scrollTop: l_obj_Target.offset().top - window.innerHeight/2            }, 1000);        }    }</script><p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.lifehack.org/585248/business-meeting\">Revealed: Secret Ways to Win New Clients in Business Meetings</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.lifehack.org\">Lifehack</a>.</p>",

This question is incredibly obscure and tricky to navigate. Should you answer honestly?</p>\n<blockquote><p>&ldquo;My strengths are I am the life of the party, I don&rsquo;t do hard drugs, I&rsquo;m tall and I have a great sense of humor. My weaknesses are I am always late, have problems with authority, steal office supplies and love to tell dirty jokes in meetings&rdquo;</p></blockquote>\n<p>Or, should you give an answer that is vague and where your weaknesses are actually strengths in disguise, such as:</p>\n<blockquote><p>&ldquo;I am a hard worker, a logical and analytic thinker and work well with others. My weaknesses are that sometimes I work too hard, I am a perfectionist, I am always over prepared and I meet every deadline &ndash; no matter how impossible it is&hellip;&rdquo;</p></blockquote>\n<p>While the first response is incredibly honest and the employer knows exactly what they are getting &ndash; you probably won&rsquo;t get hired. The second response is obvious bull crap and while you may get hired, you&rsquo;ve essentially set yourself up to fail. You&rsquo;ve also shown the hiring personnel that you lack the ability to personally reflect and self-analyze.</p>\n<h2>Why do interviewers ask the strengths and weaknesses question?</h2>\n<p>Before we dive in and work on how to answer this question, it&rsquo;s important to understand why the interviewer is asking it. The main reason the hiring manager or team asks this question<sup id=\"footnote_plugin_tooltip_8261_1\" class=\"footnote_plugin_tooltip_text\" onclick=\"footnote_moveToAnchor('footnote_plugin_reference_8261_1');\">[1]</sup><span class=\"footnote_tooltip\" id=\"footnote_plugin_tooltip_text_8261_1\"></span> is to try and determine if you possess qualities that will enable you to succeed. They also want to know what qualities you have that could hinder your job performance. Simple as that.</p>\n<h2>How to answer the strengths and weaknesses question</h2>\n<p>Now that you know why interviewers ask this question and what they are looking for, you can craft a response tailored to accurately satisfy this question. Let&rsquo;s look at the strengths first:</p>\n<h3>How to discuss your strengths</h3>\n<p><strong>Tailor your strengths to specifically match the job description</strong></p>\n<p>When facing questions about your strengths and weaknesses, always keep the job description and duties in mind. Highlight the strengths you have that are suited for that particular job. Try to include language similar to what was in the job description. Here&rsquo;s an example:</p>\n<p>You are applying for a project based position requiring lots of collaboration, meetings and interaction with other co-workers. You would want your strengths to focus on addressing these areas. Some things you could list are: deadline driven, team player, effective communicator, exceptional people skills and problem-solver. You most likely, wouldn&rsquo;t want to highlight that you work best alone and are an excellent independent worker. The strengths you highlight should match your job description.</p>\n<p><strong>Make sure your strengths align with the organization&rsquo;s mission and value system</strong></p>\n<p>Aligning your strengths with the values of the organization assists you in helping the hiring official more clearly see that you were made for the position and fit the company&rsquo;s culture. Do some research prior to the interview and determine what the organization values.</p>\n<p>For example, if a tech company has on their website the following phrase: &ldquo;&hellip;providing practical and innovative solutions for all of your technology needs&hellip;&rdquo;, you may want to include in your list of strengths: creative, innovative thinking and pragmatic.</p>\n<p><strong>Be able to explain and provide a concrete example for each strength</strong></p>\n<p>The best and most efficient way to attack this is to provide an example that demonstrates multiple strengths. This is the quickest and most concise way to answer this portion of the question without going on and on about yourself. It also communicates that you are precise and are prepared.</p>\n<p>Let&rsquo;s say you are interviewing for a position as a sales manager and you strengths are: you&rsquo;re great with people, you&rsquo;re an excellent communicator and you are flexible. You could say:</p>\n<blockquote><p>&ldquo;My strengths are: I&rsquo;m great with people, an excellent communicator and I am very flexible. A great example of this is on one occasion in my last position as a sales associate, I was confronted by an angry customer who stormed into the store demanding a full refund on a recent purchase. The customer had purchased merchandise online, did not have a receipt for the item or any proof of purchase. Our store policy was that online purchases were exchange or store credit only.</p></blockquote>\n<blockquote><p>I was able to calm the customer down and listened intently to his complaint. I determined that the customer had purchased the wrong product. I explained how both products worked and the differences between the two. The customer gladly exchanged the original product for the new, more expensive one and happily paid the difference in price between the two.&rdquo;</p></blockquote>\n<p>The candidate was able to provide three job specific strengths and back them up with solid proof. When preparing your answer to this question prior to the interview, come up with two or three examples just in case they ask for more and to give you options, in case one is more apropos than another.</p>\n<h3>How to discuss your weaknesses</h3>\n<p>Discussing weaknesses can be a bit more tricky than discussing your strengths. If the interviewer poses the question where they are grouped together such as: &ldquo;What are your greatest strengths and weaknesses?&rdquo; A good rule of thumb is to discuss the weaknesses first<sup id=\"footnote_plugin_tooltip_8261_2\" class=\"footnote_plugin_tooltip_text\" onclick=\"footnote_moveToAnchor('footnote_plugin_reference_8261_2');\">[2]</sup><span class=\"footnote_tooltip\" id=\"footnote_plugin_tooltip_text_8261_2\"></span>and end on a positive note. Here are three things to keep in mind when discussing your weaknesses:</p>\n<p><strong>Be authentic</strong></p>\n<p>Give an answer that legitimately touches on an area where you struggle. Providing an honest answer makes you more authentic, trustworthy and believable. It is also so much easier to discuss something you genuinely connect with versus something you&rsquo;ve fabricated for the moment.</p>\n<p>A great example could be the fact that you are a global or &ldquo;big picture&rdquo; thinker. You could explain that sometimes you can become overly concerned with the big picture that you may miss some of the smaller details.</p>\n<p><strong>Make sure the weakness is minor and will not directly effect your job performance</strong></p>\n<p>Pick weaknesses that are relatively small, will not directly effect your job performance, is not contradictory to the organization&rsquo;s mission and core values and does not reflect poorly on your character and integrity. So you may not want to divulge that you are a compulsive liar, petty thief, use drugs, or cheat on your taxes.</p>\n<p>If you were applying for a job as a staff accountant you could pick as your weakness: public speaking, delegating tasks, and being a bit too straight forward at times.</p>\n<p>Cast your weakness in a positive light and refrain from going on and on about them. Don&rsquo;t be overly critical of yourself and avoid self-deprecation. The trick here is striking a balance between being honest and humble while still maintaining your confidence.</p>\n<p><strong>State your weakness and chase it with a solution</strong></p>\n<p>The best thing about the &ldquo;describe your weaknesses,&rdquo; question is that our deficiencies &ndash; no matter what they are &ndash; are fixable. This question affords you the opportunity to show that you are self-aware, own your deficiencies and are proactively working to correct them.</p>\n<p>Let&rsquo;s look at the example above. If you are applying for a position as a staff accountant and your weaknesses are public speaking, delegating tasks, and being a bit too straight forward at times, you could frame your response like this:</p>\n<blockquote><p>&ldquo;One weakness that I have is that I am not fond of speaking in front of large groups. To help me in this area, I make it a priority to be well prepared when I have to speak. I also make sure that I have a good set of talking points with me if I know there is a chance I may be asked to speak, impromptu, in a large-scale meeting. I am also a member of Toastmasters Club<sup id=\"footnote_plugin_tooltip_8261_3\" class=\"footnote_plugin_tooltip_text\" onclick=\"footnote_moveToAnchor('footnote_plugin_reference_8261_3');\">[3]</sup><span class=\"footnote_tooltip\" id=\"footnote_plugin_tooltip_text_8261_3\"></span>so I am confident and communicate well, but I still do feel the butterflies sometimes.</p></blockquote>\n<blockquote><p>Another one of my weakness is that I tend to do extra work in lieu of delegating it. To help with this, I make it a point to be aware of the strengths and aptitudes of the people who could assist with these tasks. This way I immediately know who should perform the task and am confident that the work will be done well.</p></blockquote>\n<blockquote><p>I can also be a bit to straightforward at times. To help me catch and stop myself from being overly direct, I have instituted my own personal five minute rule for written communication. So, I&rsquo;ll craft an email, put it aside for five minutes and then go back and find at least three places where I can soften the language a bit and then I hit send. It takes a few extra minutes but those extra minutes would be spent explaining what I meant or apologizing for being so blunt. I truly enjoy my colleagues and really work to be a pleasant professional.&rdquo;</p></blockquote>\n<h2>In a nutshell</h2>\n<p>When facing the dreaded strengths and weaknesses question, keep in mind the interviewer&rsquo;s intent. He or she is looking for a good fit. A single answer won&rsquo;t make or break the interview, unless, of course, you say something particularly egregious. Focus your time and energy on your strengths statement and highlight what you have to offer. You are what they are looking for &ndash; and the proof is in your answer to this question.</p><div class=\"footnote_container_prepare\">\t<h2>Reference</h2></div><div id=\"footnote_references_container\" style=\"\">\t<table class=\"footnote-reference-container\">\t\t<tbody>\t\t<tr>\t<td class=\"footnote_plugin_index\"><span id=\"footnote_plugin_reference_8261_1\">[1]</span></td>\t<td class=\"footnote_plugin_link\"><span onclick=\"footnote_moveToAnchor('footnote_plugin_tooltip_8261_1');\">^</span></td>\t<td class=\"footnote_plugin_text\">the Balance: <a href=\"https://www.thebalance.com/strengths-and-weaknesses-interview-questions-2061221\" target=\"_blank\">Strength and Weakness Interview Question</a></td></tr><tr>\t<td class=\"footnote_plugin_index\"><span id=\"footnote_plugin_reference_8261_2\">[2]</span></td>\t<td class=\"footnote_plugin_link\"><span onclick=\"footnote_moveToAnchor('footnote_plugin_tooltip_8261_2');\">^</span></td>\t<td class=\"footnote_plugin_text\">Monster: <a href=\"https://www.monster.com/career-advice/article/greatest-strengths-and-weaknesses\" target=\"_blank\">List of strengths and weaknesses</a></td></tr><tr>\t<td class=\"footnote_plugin_index\"><span id=\"footnote_plugin_reference_8261_3\">[3]</span></td>\t<td class=\"footnote_plugin_link\"><span onclick=\"footnote_moveToAnchor('footnote_plugin_tooltip_8261_3');\">^</span></td>\t<td class=\"footnote_plugin_text\">Toastmasters International: <a href=\"https://www.toastmasters.org/about\" target=\"_blank\">About</a></td></tr>\t\t</tbody>\t</table></div><script type=\"text/javascript\">\tfunction footnote_expand_reference_container() {\t\tjQuery(\"#footnote_references_container\").show();        jQuery(\"#footnote_reference_container_collapse_button\").text(\"-\");\t}    function footnote_collapse_reference_container() {        jQuery(\"#footnote_references_container\").hide();        jQuery(\"#footnote_reference_container_collapse_button\").text(\"+\");    }\tfunction footnote_expand_collapse_reference_container() {\t\tif (jQuery(\"#footnote_references_container\").is(\":hidden\")) {            footnote_expand_reference_container();\t\t} else {            footnote_collapse_reference_container();\t\t}\t}    function footnote_moveToAnchor(p_str_TargetID) {        footnote_expand_reference_container();        var l_obj_Target = jQuery(\"#\" + p_str_TargetID);        if(l_obj_Target.length) {            jQuery('html, body').animate({                scrollTop: l_obj_Target.offset().top - window.innerHeight/2            }, 1000);        }    }</script><p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.lifehack.org/579949/how-talk-about-your-strengths-and-weaknesses-interviews\">How to Talk about Your Strengths and Weaknesses in Interviews</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.lifehack.org\">Lifehack</a>.</p>",

Just because so many people are in one doesn&rsquo;t mean they are easy. In fact, most of the relationship advice out there talks about how they almost never work out.</p>\n<p>That doesn&rsquo;t have to happen to you. LDR&rsquo;s are definitely challenging, you just have to ask yourself if you&rsquo;re ready to take on this unique kind of relationship before you commit.</p>\n<p><img class=\"size-full wp-image-585046 aligncenter\" src=\"http://cdn-media-2.lifehack.org/wp-content/files/2017/05/28222018/giphy-1.gif\" width=\"500\" height=\"226\" data-lh-image-id=\"585046\" srcset=\"http://cdn-media-2.lifehack.org/wp-content/files/2017/05/28222018/giphy-1.gif 500w, http://media.lifehack.org/wp-content/files/2017/05/28222018/giphy-1-380.gif 380w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px\"></p>\n<h2>Challenging, But Not Impossible</h2>\n<p>With most of the relationship advice out there pointing to how LDR&rsquo;s are most likely to fail, it can be pretty demotivating and make you start doubting if it&rsquo;s a good idea or not. Seriously, how could a relationship ever overcome the obstacle of long distance?</p>\n<p>With the right relationship advice, you can work through these challenges and potentially end up with a lasting and fulfilling relationship &ndash; if you&rsquo;re willing to put in the effort.</p>\n<p>Don&rsquo;t believe it? Plenty of people have given relationship advice about all the reasons that LDR&rsquo;s really can work. Maybe you&rsquo;re wondering, &ldquo;if something is so difficult, why not search for a partner who lives closer to you?&rdquo; Because if you are willing to put in the time and effort, you could build an incredibly strong emotional connection with your partner. By the time the two of you make the decision to be closer, or live together, or get married, you will likely have a more fulfilling and healthier relationship than a lot of other couples. The distance between you two can actually work to bring you closer.</p>\n<h2>Overcoming the Challenges</h2>\n<p>Ready to tackle the challenges of a LDR? Take a look at this relationship advice and find out what the biggest challenges are and what you can do to work your way through them.</p>\n<h3>Growing Apart</h3>\n<p>The two of you can&rsquo;t see each other every day or even every week for that matter. You are forced to maintain your relationship via phone calls and video chats (if the internet connection is strong enough). You life continues wherever you are and so does your partner&rsquo;s, and they aren&rsquo;t the same. The two of you will be growing and changing with the real possibility that this will cause you to grow apart.</p>\n<p>How do you make sure to grow and change together despite the distance? The key here is to maintain regular and frequent communication. If your budget allows, try to visit each other as much as possible. This way, your individual changes don&rsquo;t come as a surprise. Be honest with each other and bring it up the moment you start to feel like you&rsquo;re growing apart.</p>\n<h3>Feeling Jealous</h3>\n<p>You are both mature and intelligent adults, trying to be supportive of each other&rsquo;s independence. But every so often, jealousy rears its ugly head. It&rsquo;s so easy to start worrying about who your partner spends all their time with and it&rsquo;s only natural that you wish it could be with you.</p>\n<p>Don&rsquo;t let your jealousy control your interactions with your significant other. If you suspect they might have feelings for somebody else, ask. Don&rsquo;t accuse. Recognize if your jealousy stems for your own insecurity and try to handle it together. It&rsquo;s okay to ask for reassurance from time to time, that&rsquo;s what relationships are for. But, make sure you fight jealousy early on so it doesn&rsquo;t get out of control and take over your relationship.</p>\n<h3>Misunderstanding the Other Person&rsquo;s Intention</h3>\n<p>When you&rsquo;re in a long distance relationship, the two of you primarily rely on verbal or written communication. You don&rsquo;t have the luxury of being face to face and seeing nonverbal behavior or facial expressions. It&rsquo;s easy to misunderstand the intent behind what your significant other is saying. And these misunderstandings can lead to arguments.</p>\n<p>To avoid this problem, try to be as clear as possible when writing or speaking. Don&rsquo;t assume that the other person will understand or even know exactly what you&rsquo;re talking about. If you aren&rsquo;t sure you understood your partner, ask for clarification. Get out of the habit of reacting, instead make sure you understand everything first.</p>\n<h2>Making it Last</h2>\n<p>There is no doubt about it, being in a long distance relationship can be challenging. If you stick to this relationship advice, put in extra effort, and try to be patient, you may end up in one of the most fulfilling and emotionally rewarding relationships of your life.</p>\n<p><span class=\"credit\">Featured photo credit: <a href=\"https://www.pexels.com/photo/bag-electronics-girl-hands-359757\" target=\"_blank\">Tofros.com via pexels.com</a></span></p><div class=\"footnote_container_prepare\">\t<h2>Reference</h2></div><div id=\"footnote_references_container\" style=\"\">\t<table class=\"footnote-reference-container\">\t\t<tbody>\t\t<tr>\t<td class=\"footnote_plugin_index\"><span id=\"footnote_plugin_reference_6857_1\">[1]</span></td>\t<td class=\"footnote_plugin_link\"><span onclick=\"footnote_moveToAnchor('footnote_plugin_tooltip_6857_1');\">^</span></td>\t<td class=\"footnote_plugin_text\">longdistancerelationshipstatistics.com:&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.longdistancerelationshipstatistics.com/\" target=\"_blank\">LongDistanceRelationshipStatistics</a></td></tr>\t\t</tbody>\t</table></div><script type=\"text/javascript\">\tfunction footnote_expand_reference_container() {\t\tjQuery(\"#footnote_references_container\").show();        jQuery(\"#footnote_reference_container_collapse_button\").text(\"-\");\t}    function footnote_collapse_reference_container() {        jQuery(\"#footnote_references_container\").hide();        jQuery(\"#footnote_reference_container_collapse_button\").text(\"+\");    }\tfunction footnote_expand_collapse_reference_container() {\t\tif (jQuery(\"#footnote_references_container\").is(\":hidden\")) {            footnote_expand_reference_container();\t\t} else {            footnote_collapse_reference_container();\t\t}\t}    function footnote_moveToAnchor(p_str_TargetID) {        footnote_expand_reference_container();        var l_obj_Target = jQuery(\"#\" + p_str_TargetID);        if(l_obj_Target.length) {            jQuery('html, body').animate({                scrollTop: l_obj_Target.offset().top - window.innerHeight/2            }, 1000);        }    }</script><p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.lifehack.org/583597/can-long-distance-relationship-really-last-not\">Can a Long Distance Relationship Really Last or Not?</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.lifehack.org\">Lifehack</a>.</p>",

Leadership skills are subjective &ndash; you can have many different styles that work to varying degrees. Our modern day challenges mean methods of leadership are influenced by multiple factors, and adapting to these and keeping your leadership qualities high is an indicator of a good leader.</p>\n<p>Some people find themselves in management roles without having developed these crucial skills. Perhaps you&rsquo;re a manager and struggle to lead your team? Or maybe you&rsquo;re not in a management role, but feel you want to create better leadership skills?</p>\n<h2>The Benefits of Having Good Leadership Skills</h2>\n<p>Whether you&rsquo;re in a leadership role or not, recognizing and implementing good leadership skills within your team or business can help your productivity and team relationships to no end.</p>\n<p>It can even come down to implementing small changes that make a huge improvement. There are many ways you can do this, but there is one fundamental similarity with all effective leaders, and that&rsquo;s <strong>having the ability to establish a co-operating following with either a team or an individual.</strong></p>\n<h2><strong>What Qualities and Skills Should a Good Leader Possess?</strong></h2>\n<p>So what qualities make a positive, successful leader? The ability to set and achieve challenging goals, knowing when to make good, solid decisions, and at the same time be inspiring and supportive toward others are all skills that a person in a leadership role aspires to accomplish.</p>\n<p>But there is no one-size-fits-all when it comes to good leadership skills. It&rsquo;s all about using your personality to its greatest effect while being mindful of how your team works best and the goals you wish to achieve.</p>\n<h3>1. Being the Source of Positivity</h3>\n<p>Positivity is the number one mindset you should bring to a team or work environment. Positivity spreads, as does negativity, so keeping a good, positive mentality helps to motivate others as well as yourself. It forms the working atmosphere and provides energy, which goes toward better productivity and keeps people wanting to continually do their best.</p>\n<h3>2. Know Yourself and Your Team Well</h3>\n<p>Knowing your team&rsquo;s strengths and weaknesses and being able to address them in order to get the best out of the team as a whole is one of the best skills you can develop. It&rsquo;s all about using your resources well and to everyone&rsquo;s advantage. It&rsquo;s also about knowing your own strengths and weaknesses &ndash; using them well and working on your professional growth.</p>\n<h3>3. Be Confident in Your Decisions to Make Everyone Head in the Same Direction</h3>\n<p>Confidence gains respect, and when challenges arise, keeping yourself and your team calm in the face of setbacks shows that you are focusing on the larger goal rather than worrying about the minor bumps in the road. Having the confidence to stick by your decisions and believe in yourself and your abilities will keep you level-headed.</p>\n<h3>4. Keep Your Focus Strong</h3>\n<p>Leadership requires a lot of focus. Being able to visualize and see the end goal, whether it&rsquo;s managing a big project or building up a small business, is highly important. But keeping that focus strong when challenges are thrown at you is the true trait of a leader. Focus means keeping on top of your team, together with your own responsibilities, without distractions.</p>\n<h3>5. Delegate to Make Your Team Feel Trusted</h3>\n<p>Delegating is all about trust, and building trust within your team cultivates a perception of respect with others. Clever delegating can use people&rsquo;s strengths well, but also create positive challenges in order to allow certain members of your team to grow and gain more skills in the process.</p>\n<h3>6. Deliver What You Think Clearly to Get Everyone on the Same Page</h3>\n<p>Good communication is paramount. However, it&rsquo;s not always about <em>what</em> you say but <em>how</em> you get your point across. Good leaders are articulate and able to clearly explain their visions, wants, and needs. It&rsquo;s important that you and your team are on the same page at all times, so people with good leadership skills make it clear that they are available to communicate with on a daily basis. This will show you&rsquo;re dependable and open.</p>\n<h3>7. Keep Your Words and Promises</h3>\n<p>You absolutely have to lead by example to be a good leader. People are less likely to work hard if they don&rsquo;t see you doing the same. Showing your team that you&rsquo;re on their side and working hard right next to them develops respect. Keeping your word and promises is also a must if you want to been seen as committed and trustworthy, so stick by what you say you&rsquo;ll do.</p>\n<h3>8. Get Your Team to Generate Creative Ideas Together</h3>\n<p>Having a creative side helps immensely when plans go out the window. Having to make quick decisions is vital, and the ability to think outside the box can allow you to create the best options. Involving your team without making rash decisions isn&rsquo;t a sign of weakness either, it&rsquo;s about rallying your best resources to come up with the best solutions.</p>\n<h3>9. Trust Yourself So Your Team Can Trust You</h3>\n<p>When things are uncertain and the pressure is on, sometimes you will have to follow your gut feeling. Of course, knowledge of similar past experiences can help in these situations, but when you&rsquo;re faced with a new challenge, you need to have the confidence to trust in yourself and your ability to make the correct or best decision you can. Your team can&rsquo;t trust you if you can&rsquo;t trust yourself.</p>\n<h3>10. Be Flexible with Your Approach to Deal with Different Situations</h3>\n<p>Business can throw all sorts of curveballs, so being adaptable is a sign of a good leader. But it isn&rsquo;t just about adjusting to changes, having the ability to adapt your approach to different types of people and how they operate is a great skill to possess in leadership. The diversity of personalities and different ways of working means you need to be able to customize your approach toward them on an individual basis. This will inevitably get the best out of your team.</p>\n<h3>11. Be Able to Inspire and Motivate Your Team</h3>\n<p>Being able to inspire your team is a good motivational skill, and it&rsquo;s about keeping the morale of the team up with things like bonus schemes. Enthusiasm and drive is what you ultimately want in your team and making efforts to cultivate this will go toward a more productive and successful business. All too often, workers&rsquo; needs are ignored because there&rsquo;s too much focus on results, rather than looking after who or what is getting those results.</p>\n<h3>12. See Every Problem As a Challenge</h3>\n<p>The difference between a problem and a challenge is your mindset. You need to be the solution to a problem &ndash; in other words, you want to drive toward a problem, not shy away from it. By seeing a problem as a challenge you are showing your problem-solving skills and using it as a reason to learn and grow.</p>\n<h3>13. Encourage Your Team to Pursue Relentless Growth</h3>\n<p>Pushing people to be their very best stops you from having a stagnant team. A good leader knows the importance of nurturing and encouraging their team to be the best they can. Knowing that actively allowing growth will ultimately benefit your team as a whole, is an excellent skill to have as a leader.</p>\n<h3>14. Be Consistent with the Values You Set</h3>\n<p>Your employees are usually a reflection of the values you set. <em>Doing what&rsquo;s right</em> for your team and your business instead of making decisions from the space of <em>needing to be right </em>is paramount for successful leadership. Don&rsquo;t let your ego get the best of you and always be authentic in your interactions. Be the best example in all areas of work.</p>\n<h3>15. Being Open to Build Good Relationships with Your Team</h3>\n<p>A good leader doesn&rsquo;t hide crucial information. A good leader knows that a team that has full knowledge of what&rsquo;s going on at all times is a team that can function to its best ability. Trust goes out the window when you&rsquo;re seen as someone who isn&rsquo;t being entirely honest. It&rsquo;s all about building good relationships, and that includes being open, honest, and transparent.</p>\n<p>It&rsquo;s always beneficial to work on your leadership skills, especially if you&rsquo;re running a business or a project. Some people either aren&rsquo;t sure what makes a great leader, or get too focused on the importance of results instead of truly looking at themselves and seeing how much positive influence they can have on others. Be a good leader and see how you reap the positive results.</p><p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.lifehack.org/579677/leadership-definition\">Leadership Isn&#8217;t About Title or Position, But Your Ability to Influence Others</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.lifehack.org\">Lifehack</a>.</p>",

Confidence gains respect, and when challenges arise, keeping yourself and your team calm in the face of setbacks shows that you are focusing on the larger goal rather than worrying about the minor bumps in the road. Of course, knowledge of similar past experiences can help in these situations, but when you\u2019re faced with a new challenge, you need to have the confidence to trust in yourself and your ability to make the correct or best decision you can."

This vitamin is vital for calcium absorption and promoting bone growth. It can also help in regulating your immune system, blood pressure, weight loss and fighting depression. In addition, it can also help fight various diseases, such as multiple sclerosis and heart disease.</p>\n<p>As its other name suggests, we get vitamin D when we are exposed to the sunlight. But what happens if you spend more time indoors or live in a place with little sunlight? Your body needs enough vitamin D, and so you need to include more vitamin D rich foods in your diet.</p>\n<h2>Why is vitamin D so important?</h2>\n<p>One of the most important functions of vitamin D is to help our bones stay strong. As National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases explains, we need vitamin D in order to absorb calcium, and without having enough vitamin D to absorb calcium, our bones become soft and fragile.<sup id=\"footnote_plugin_tooltip_8973_1\" class=\"footnote_plugin_tooltip_text\" onclick=\"footnote_moveToAnchor('footnote_plugin_reference_8973_1');\">[1]</sup><span class=\"footnote_tooltip\" id=\"footnote_plugin_tooltip_text_8973_1\"></span></p>\n<p>Several studies confirm its multiple benefits, such as decreasing the risk of cardiovascular disease,<sup id=\"footnote_plugin_tooltip_8973_2\" class=\"footnote_plugin_tooltip_text\" onclick=\"footnote_moveToAnchor('footnote_plugin_reference_8973_2');\">[2]</sup><span class=\"footnote_tooltip\" id=\"footnote_plugin_tooltip_text_8973_2\"></span> improving the symptoms of depression,<sup id=\"footnote_plugin_tooltip_8973_3\" class=\"footnote_plugin_tooltip_text\" onclick=\"footnote_moveToAnchor('footnote_plugin_reference_8973_3');\">[3]</sup><span class=\"footnote_tooltip\" id=\"footnote_plugin_tooltip_text_8973_3\"></span> and it even helps decrease the risk of multiple sclerosis.<sup id=\"footnote_plugin_tooltip_8973_4\" class=\"footnote_plugin_tooltip_text\" onclick=\"footnote_moveToAnchor('footnote_plugin_reference_8973_4');\">[4]</sup><span class=\"footnote_tooltip\" id=\"footnote_plugin_tooltip_text_8973_4\"></span></p>\n<p>Studies have indicated that vitamin D deficiency may cause several serious conditions.

Way back in time. Paleo is short for paleolithic, (the prehistoric ages).<sup id=\"footnote_plugin_tooltip_4943_1\" class=\"footnote_plugin_tooltip_text\" onclick=\"footnote_moveToAnchor('footnote_plugin_reference_4943_1');\">[1]</sup><span class=\"footnote_tooltip\" id=\"footnote_plugin_tooltip_text_4943_1\"></span> It involves the mimicking of ancestors about 10000 years back. It is all about eating what the cavemen did before agriculture existed.</p>\n<p>Imagine a world without any farming. That is exactly what those from the Stone Age coped with. Waking up each morning, and the sole purpose each day was finding what you were going to eat and how to get it. You travel to where the food is and gather all you need along the way.</p>\n<p>Diets were made up of wild animals they came across. And every other natural food found along the way. Berries, nuts, wild fruit and vegetables.This was the practice for many thousands of years.</p>\n<p>Eating like the cavemen the notion is that the muscular lean physique will be gained.</p>\n<h2>Quick Snap on The Benefits of Paleo Diet.</h2>\n<ul><li>You get to eat diet clear from additives, chemicals or preservative</li>\n<li>The vegetables, oils, fruits, nuts and seeds are anti-inflammatory</li>\n<li>Eating more red meat&nbsp;gives you more iron and it&rsquo;s healthy for your blood</li>\n<li>A higher intake of natural fats and protein leaves you feeling full between your meals</li>\n<li>You take better natural choices so it can help you with your weight loss</li>\n</ul><p>Replicating the diet of the caveman fully is not possible as all found at stores come from farms and are not grown in the wild. Modern humans give it their best shot by using organic fruits, meats and veggies. Food grown from the ground with no pesticides or herbicides GMO interventions.</p>\n<h2>It&rsquo;s always easier to kickstart with diet with healthy desserts!

Preheat the oven to 350&ordm;F and adjust the rack to the middle position.</p>\n<p>2. Place the egg whites and lemon juice in the bowl of a standing mixer. Whisk the egg mixture on medium-high until foamy, about 30 seconds. Add the salt, cream of tartar and vanilla. Whisk the mixture on medium-high until soft peaks form, about 1-2 minutes.</p>\n<p>3. With the mixer on medium-high, slowly add 1/2 cup of the maple sugar, 1 tablespoon at a time. Sift the remaining 1/4 cup maple sugar and arrowroot flour into a small bowl. With the mixer on medium, slowly add the arrowroot mixture. Turn the speed up to medium-high and whip until smooth (there might be some tiny little lumps from the sugar, but it will melt in the oven while baking).</p>\n<p>Pour the batter into a clean (and NOT oiled), 12-cup angel food cake pan (I&rsquo;m still on the look-out for a glass or</p>\n<p>4. stainless steel angel food cake pan. If you know where to purchase one, please let me know!). Bake for 40-45 minutes, until cake is puffed and the top is just turning golden brown.</p>\n<p>5. Remove the cake from the oven. Carefully turn the cake upside-down and place on top of a can. Let cool completely, about 1 hour. Run a knife around the outside of the cake and invert onto a cake platter (you might need to shake the cake a little to get it to separate from the center tube of the cake pan). Serve alone or with whipped cream and berries.</p>\n<p>6. Note: I only test the recipes on my site with the listed ingredients and measurements.

Garnish with sifted cocoa powder, raspberries or any other desired toppings. Repeat with the remaining cakes. Store any leftovers, ungarnished, in the refrigerator for up to a day, then reheat in the microwave for 30 seconds before garnishing and eating.</li>\n</ol></div>\n<h2>9.&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.dietitiandebbie.com/2014/06/14/almond-strawberry-shortcake/\" target=\"_blank\">Almond Strawberry Shortcake</a></h2>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-588238\" src=\"http://cdn-media-2.lifehack.org/wp-content/files/2017/05/04223932/Strawberry-Shortcake-2-682x1024.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"682\" height=\"1024\" data-lh-image-id=\"588238\" srcset=\"http://cdn-media-2.lifehack.org/wp-content/files/2017/05/04223932/Strawberry-Shortcake-2-682x1024.jpg 682w, http://media.lifehack.org/wp-content/files/2017/05/04223932/Strawberry-Shortcake-2-682x1024-380.jpg 380w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 682px) 100vw, 682px\"></p>\n<div class=\"ERSIngredients\">\n<p class=\"ERSIngredientsHeader ERSHeading\"><strong>Ingredients</strong></p>\n<ul><li class=\"ingredient\">SHORTCAKE</li>\n<li class=\"ingredient\">1&frac12; cups almond flour</li>\n<li class=\"ingredient\">&frac12; cup coconut flour</li>\n<li class=\"ingredient\">&frac12; teaspoon baking powder</li>\n<li class=\"ingredient\">&frac12; teaspoon almond extract</li>\n<li class=\"ingredient\">&frac14; cup coconut milk</li>\n<li class=\"ingredient\">4 tablespoons coconut oil</li>\n<li class=\"ingredient\">3 tablespoons maple syrup</li>\n<li class=\"ingredient\">1 pint fresh strawberries (I used Drisoll&rsquo;s)</li>\n<li class=\"ingredient\">COCONUT WHIPPED CREAM:</li>\n<li class=\"ingredient\">1 can full fat coconut milk, refrigerated overnight.</li>\n<li class=\"ingredient\">1 teaspoon maple syrup (optional)</li>\n</ul><p class=\"ERSClear\">\n</p></div>\n<div class=\"ERSInstructions\">\n<div class=\"ERSInstructionsHeader ERSHeading\"><strong>Instructions</strong></div>\n<ol><li class=\"instruction\">Preheat oven to 350 degrees Fahrenheit.</li>\n<li class=\"instruction\">In a large mixing bowl, whisk together the almond and coconut flour and baking powder.

A disciplined system of living where you never sweat the small stuff, and keep all of your priorities in check.</strong></p>\n<h2>Stoicism is meant to be practiced, not discussed.</h2>\n<p>Stoicism is the endurance of pain or hardship without a display of feelings and without complaint. It is a unique philosophy in the respect that it is meant to be practiced, and not just pontificated and debated upon. You must find your true passion, your true calling, and nurture it. The practice also emphasizes the importance of virtue, and a distinct separation between emotion and reaction.</p>\n<h2>Practiced by historical and modern men alike, the ideology is finding it&rsquo;s way back into the mainstream.</h2>\n<p>The word Stoic is derived from the Greek term Stoa Poikile meaning literally, &ldquo;the painted porch.&rdquo; It is influenced by an open market in Athens where the Stoics would famously gather to discuss important matters and teach philosophy to young, eager minds.</p>\n<p>The philosophy itself was founded as a Hellenistic&nbsp;<sup id=\"footnote_plugin_tooltip_1367_1\" class=\"footnote_plugin_tooltip_text\" onclick=\"footnote_moveToAnchor('footnote_plugin_reference_1367_1');\">[1]</sup><span class=\"footnote_tooltip\" id=\"footnote_plugin_tooltip_text_1367_1\"></span>(the time period between the death of Alexander the Great who was himself a Stoic, and the beginning of the Roman Empire) philosophy circa 300 B.C.E. by Zeno of Citium.</p>\n<h2>Stoicism is not the practice of avoiding issues, but rather transforming them into opportunities.</h2>\n<p>Incredibly misunderstood, the belief system has been given a negative stigma&nbsp;<sup id=\"footnote_plugin_tooltip_1367_2\" class=\"footnote_plugin_tooltip_text\" onclick=\"footnote_moveToAnchor('footnote_plugin_reference_1367_2');\">[2]</sup><span class=\"footnote_tooltip\" id=\"footnote_plugin_tooltip_text_1367_2\"></span>, as well as those who choose to practice it. It has been said that those who choose to lead a Stoic life choose to lead a life of avoidance and denial. A bleak existence where nothing is faced head on. Hardships are tolerated and accepted instead of challenging and overcoming the obstacles.</p>\n<p>Perhaps for some Stoics this may be true. Acceptance is a virtue of high regard, and must be mastered to truly achieve mental strength. But the premise of stoicism is not the avoidance of obstacles; it&rsquo;s the transformation of the obstacle. Turning every obstacle into a new opportunity. Instead of mindlessly running into the same dead end, creating a way around it. That is the Stoic way of thinking.</p>\n<h2>Core Values of Stoicism</h2>\n<p>As you might imagine, after centuries of discussion by the most intellectual minds throughout history, the complexity of Stoicism has developed many facets. As mentioned, many intellectuals, artists, writers and entrepreneurs live their life by these guidelines to inspire creativity and install discipline&nbsp;<sup id=\"footnote_plugin_tooltip_1367_3\" class=\"footnote_plugin_tooltip_text\" onclick=\"footnote_moveToAnchor('footnote_plugin_reference_1367_3');\">[3]</sup><span class=\"footnote_tooltip\" id=\"footnote_plugin_tooltip_text_1367_3\"></span>.</p>\n<p>&bull; This system is built for action, not debate.</p>\n<p>&bull; The source of our discontent is derived from our impulsive need to act on emotion rather than reason. I.e. many of us don&rsquo;t think before we act.</p>\n<p>&bull; Stoicism reminds us how short life is, and how unpredictable it can be.</p>\n<p>&bull; Always be in control of yourself, unwavering in your solidarity.</p>\n<p>&bull; It helps us to overcome toxic emotions, training ourselves not to get upset over things which we cannot control.</p>\n<p>&bull; All emotions come within ourselves. No one can make you feel any emotion, no matter how strong. How you feel and how you react is all entirely mental.</p>\n<p><strong>Example:</strong> A stranger is rude to you during your commute. You have the choice to be upset, to feel sorry for them for being miserable, or to disregard it and feel absolutely nothing at all. Whether or not you feel justified with your reactive emotions is irrelevant. You are in charge of the reactive emotion. It is too easy to place the blame on external objects.</p>\n<p>&bull; Find a mentor or model- use them to inspire and encourage yourself to do better and do more.</p>\n<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Without a ruler to do it against, you can&rsquo;t make the crooked straight.&rdquo; &ndash; Seneca</p></blockquote>\n<p>&bull; Realize that if you fail, you will survive. You will learn, you will adjust, and you will overcome. Failure it not the enemy. It feeds fuel to the fire.</p>\n<p>&bull; Read books that inspire you and expand your knowledge in the areas that you want to grow in. Apply that knowledge to further yourself.</p>\n<p>&bull; Stop candy coating things &ndash; speak honestly and with conviction. People will respect you for your bluntness. Everyone needs a friend who will tell them the truth when they need to hear it.</p>\n<p>&bull; Consider what you spend the most time on. Is it beneficial to your growth? Unless your goal in life is to become a social media super star, browsing Instagram probably isn&rsquo;t going to advance any opportunities for you. Pick up a book. Listen to a seminar. Do. Something. Productive.</p>\n<p>&bull; Fight procrastination. This one I particularly struggle with. But it&rsquo;s true, get your obligations sorted out in a timely manner, leaving time for leisure and your personal goals.</p>\n<p>&bull; Time is your most precious resource. Don&rsquo;t waste it.</p>\n<p>&bull; Engulf yourself in your passion and what you love. Don&rsquo;t waste your time being lazy and taking it easy. Push yourself.</p>\n<blockquote><p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t love yourself enough. Or you&rsquo;d love your nature too, and what it demands of you. People who love what they do wear themselves down doing it, they even forget to wash or eat.&rdquo; &ndash; Seneca</p></blockquote>\n<h2>Three Men famously set the standard for what it truly means to be a Stoic.</h2>\n<p>Although many powerful individuals throughout history have famously practiced and helped to shape the foundation of Stoicism, three men in particular brought Stoicism to a new platform, creating a place for it among the scholars.</p>\n<h3>Marcus Aurelius</h3>\n<p>The Emperor of the Roman Empire, the most powerful man in existence at the time, ordained by the Gods and with wealth beyond comprehension, preached words of humility, compassion, and restraint. Each day he would write in his journal, notes about what it truly means to be a Stoic. Although that was not his intention at the time. He was merely just trying to better himself.</p>\n<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Run down the list of those who felt intense anger at something: the most famous, the most unfortunate, the most hated, the most whatever: Where is all that now? Smoke, dust, legend&hellip;or not even a legend. Think of all the examples. And how trivial the things we want so passionately are.&rdquo; &ndash; Marcus Aurelius</p></blockquote>\n<h3>Epictetus</h3>\n<p>Born as a slave, he managed to gain his freedom as a teenager. After years of enduring the horrors of slavery, he learned how to channel his emotions and overcome his circumstances by maintaining psychological control. He studied Stoicism as a slave, and went on to open his own school to pass on his teachings after having been freed from slavery.</p>\n<blockquote><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not what happens to you, but how you react to it that matters.&rdquo; &ndash; Epictetus</p></blockquote>\n<h3>Seneca</h3>\n<p>A man of noble and wealthy upbringing, a Philosopher who was a close consultant of the emperor Claudius. Claudius exiled Seneca for eight years for supposed adultery. During his exile, he wrote to his family to comfort them, taking no pity on himself or his circumstances. He was released from exile to tutor Nero, son of Claudius who would later rise into power. Seneca stayed a loyal consultant until his suicide was ordered by Nero. Even then he took no pity on himself, just the people who would mourn over his death.</p>\n<blockquote><p>&ldquo;We are more often frightened than hurt; and we suffer more from imagination than from reality.&rdquo; &ndash; Seneca</p></blockquote>\n<h2>How can you practice Stoicism in your everyday life? It&rsquo;s quite simple, really.</h2>\n<h3>Separate Yourself from Your Comforts</h3>\n<p>As Seneca suggests, we need to take the time to practice poverty to realize how little we really need. <sup id=\"footnote_plugin_tooltip_1367_4\" class=\"footnote_plugin_tooltip_text\" onclick=\"footnote_moveToAnchor('footnote_plugin_reference_1367_4');\">[4]</sup><span class=\"footnote_tooltip\" id=\"footnote_plugin_tooltip_text_1367_4\"></span> He meant quite literally to go sleep on the streets with nothing but the clothes on your back and what little food and water you need to get by. You can practice this by actually spending a night living on the street, it would be shockingly humbling for sure. A less extreme option would be to go for a trip with a very small bag of limited items. You are not allowed to buy anything else, only bring what you actually need. By the end of the trip, you&rsquo;ll probably have a few items that you didn&rsquo;t even touch.</p>\n<h3>Turn The Obstacle Upside Down</h3>\n<p>Train your perception to look at things from a broader perspective. Not every occurrence is either cut and dry negative or positive. Perhaps you are faced with an issue, and it can be a bit deterring and it feels like everything is falling apart. Not too quick. Take a moment to walk away and refresh for a moment. Look at it through a new light. There is an opportunity here, you just have to find it. Use it as momentum to better yourself and your goals.</p>\n<h3>Everything is Temporary</h3>\n<p>Do not dwell. If something didn&rsquo;t work out, get over it. Everything is fleeting, especially passion. Think of the things that you so passionately wanted that are bland to you now. A shirt, a new phone, a love interest. It all becomes old and dull at some point. Those things are all pointless on the grand scheme, because you yourself have such a small part in this world that we live in.</p>\n<p>Most importantly, don&rsquo;t get caught up in your passionate emotions. They eat away at your well being and distract you from your goals. Sure, someone may have done you wrong and for that they bite the big them. Maybe they&rsquo;re horrible, but let them be. Someone else&rsquo; shortcomings won&rsquo;t dull your shine unless you let them. So don&rsquo;t sweat it.</p>\n<h2>Related Articles Recommended To Live A Stoic Life</h2>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.lifehack.org/574450/really-strong-predictor-success-self-awareness-with-ways-boost\">A Really Strong Predictor of Success: Self Awareness (with Ways to Boost It)</a> by Craig J Todd</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.lifehack.org/569422/what-are-values-and-why-need-them-for-fulfilling-life\">Why Our Personal Values Matter More Than Ever Today</a> by Heather Poole</p><div class=\"footnote_container_prepare\">\t<h2>Reference</h2></div><div id=\"footnote_references_container\" style=\"\">\t<table class=\"footnote-reference-container\">\t\t<tbody>\t\t<tr>\t<td class=\"footnote_plugin_index\"><span id=\"footnote_plugin_reference_1367_1\">[1]</span></td>\t<td class=\"footnote_plugin_link\"><span onclick=\"footnote_moveToAnchor('footnote_plugin_tooltip_1367_1');\">^</span></td>\t<td class=\"footnote_plugin_text\">Stanford Encyclopaedia of Philosophy: <a href=\"https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/stoicism/\" target=\"_blank\">Stoicism</a></td></tr><tr>\t<td class=\"footnote_plugin_index\"><span id=\"footnote_plugin_reference_1367_2\">[2]</span></td>\t<td class=\"footnote_plugin_link\"><span onclick=\"footnote_moveToAnchor('footnote_plugin_tooltip_1367_2');\">^</span></td>\t<td class=\"footnote_plugin_text\">aeon.co:&nbsp;<a href=\"https://aeon.co/essays/why-stoicism-is-one-of-the-best-mind-hacks-ever-devised\" target=\"_blank\">Indifference is a power</a></td></tr><tr>\t<td class=\"footnote_plugin_index\"><span id=\"footnote_plugin_reference_1367_3\">[3]</span></td>\t<td class=\"footnote_plugin_link\"><span onclick=\"footnote_moveToAnchor('footnote_plugin_tooltip_1367_3');\">^</span></td>\t<td class=\"footnote_plugin_text\">99U:&nbsp;The Stoic: <a href=\"http://99u.com/articles/24401/a-makers-guidebook-9-stoic-principles-to-nurture-your-life-and-work\" target=\"_blank\">9 Principles to Help You Keep Calm in Chaos</a></td></tr><tr>\t<td class=\"footnote_plugin_index\"><span id=\"footnote_plugin_reference_1367_4\">[4]</span></td>\t<td class=\"footnote_plugin_link\"><span onclick=\"footnote_moveToAnchor('footnote_plugin_tooltip_1367_4');\">^</span></td>\t<td class=\"footnote_plugin_text\">Daily Stoic: <a href=\"https://dailystoic.com/what-is-stoicism-a-definition-3-stoic-exercises-to-get-you-started/\" target=\"_blank\">What Is Stoicism?

Proteins are especially important for gym goers because they&rsquo;re essential for building and repairing muscles and maintaining glycogen levels that support energy. That&rsquo;s why you probably overheard fellow gym members talking about their <strong>high-protein, low-fat foods</strong>.</p>\n<p>When you start a workout regimen, many concerns will come up. Will you be able to maintain muscle mass at a calorie deficit? Is it possible to maintain/gain muscle while losing fat? How do you maximize your performance at the gym? And on many days you will find yourself wondering how to recover from that muscle soreness as fast as possible. The answer to all these questions is protein.</p>\n<h2><strong>Diet Essentials for fitness enthusiasts</strong></h2>\n<ul><li>High protein foods are very filling; they help build muscle, reduce cravings and fire up weight loss. Proteins are the most essential macronutrient for gym goers. In contrast, high-fat foods can slow down digestion and make food sit in your stomach for too long especially just before a workout.</li>\n<li>Breakfast is extremely important to pump you full of energy at the beginning of your day. Complex carbohydrates, lean protein, healthy fats, and a variety of fruits and vegetables can all help boost energy and maximize nutrient levels. The most important macros to include in your breakfast, however, are proteins and complex carbohydrates.</li>\n<li>Foods that support healthy brain functions should be a staple in every healthy diet. The <a href=\"https://www.consumerhealthdigest.com/brain-health/brain-foods.html\" target=\"_blank\">best brain foods</a> are those rich in omega-3 fatty acids, antioxidants. These include wild caught salmon, blueberries, nuts and seeds and avocados.</li>\n</ul><h2><strong>Do you feel tired easily during workouts?</strong></h2>\n<ul><li>If so, your body may be missing a substance called creatine to help top up energy levels. Creative is also leaked out of the muscles during workouts. This increases a condition called Delayed Onset Muscle Soreness (DOMS)</li>\n<li>Creatine is found in high-protein foods such as red meat or in protein powders. 3-5 grams before and after working out provides that extra boost of energy.</li>\n</ul><h2><strong>How much protein you really need?</strong></h2>\n<p>If you have been doing your fitness research, odds are you have heard about the importance of protein from every single source. Many exercisers, especially those focusing on weight training, consume large amounts of protein in every meal. This probably left you wondering about your protein needs.</p>\n<ul><li>The average adult needs at least 1 gram per pound of body weight. For example, if you weigh 175 pounds, you need between 140-227 grams of protein per day.</li>\n<li>Eating high-protein foods increases the number of calories your body naturally burns each day and is the key factor in preserving lean muscle while burning fat.</li>\n<li>During workouts, small tearing occurs in your muscles, so you need the amino acids in protein to repair and rebuild those muscles, and that&rsquo;s how they become bigger and stronger.</li>\n<li>If this damage is not repaired, the body will use muscle tone and bone minerals to substitute, so instead of losing fat, you end up losing muscle mass.</li>\n</ul><h2><strong>Here are TOP 10 high-protein low fat foods you can add to your diet:</strong></h2>\n<p><strong>1.

Do you think creativity is something we are born with? Creativity is more than the simple left versus right brain. It is more than your logical hemisphere compared to your creative hemisphere. Creativity and learning takes place when we are able to connect new knowledge with knowledge we were already familiar with. Creativity is something we can all develop. In fact, it has been scientifically proven that creativity can be cultivated.</p>\n<p>Prior to the last couple of years, I used to think creativity was something you were born with. I believed one of the myths of creativity and used it as an excuse. Do you associate with any of these common myths about creativity? Common myths:<sup id=\"footnote_plugin_tooltip_4803_1\" class=\"footnote_plugin_tooltip_text\" onclick=\"footnote_moveToAnchor('footnote_plugin_reference_4803_1');\">[1]</sup><span class=\"footnote_tooltip\" id=\"footnote_plugin_tooltip_text_4803_1\"></span></p>\n<ul><li>You are born with it.</li>\n<li>You have to be right-brained.</li>\n<li>It falls into your lap.</li>\n<li>You&rsquo;ve got to be a little mad.</li>\n</ul><p>Everyone has fell victim to at least one of these myths, but anyone can be creative, not just the privileged few. Let&rsquo;s take a look at how some people embrace this mindset and become more creative than the rest.</p>\n<h2>They are good at making connections between different ideas.</h2>\n<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Part of creativity is picking the little bubbles that come up to your conscious mind, and picking which one to let grow and which one to give access to more of your mind.&rdquo; &ndash; Nancy Andreasen</p></blockquote>\n<p>Yevgeniy Brikman has an interesting analogy for creativity. He looks at creative thinking as a deck of index cards. He remarks,</p>\n<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Imagine you have a deck of index cards and that each card has a word or phrase on it. These cards represent the ideas and thoughts that are floating in your head.&rdquo;<sup id=\"footnote_plugin_tooltip_4803_2\" class=\"footnote_plugin_tooltip_text\" onclick=\"footnote_moveToAnchor('footnote_plugin_reference_4803_2');\">[2]</sup><span class=\"footnote_tooltip\" id=\"footnote_plugin_tooltip_text_4803_2\"></span></p>\n<ol><li><strong>Preparation</strong>. So, did you think this would start with an idea? Well, you would be wrong. Here we are gathering facts and existing ideas about our problem. In the first stage, start asking questions in order to start generating ideas.</li>\n<li><strong>Incubation</strong>. This stage is important. Go for a jog or take a bath (Thank Archimedes for this idea!), but make sure you allow the problem to wander in your mind.</li>\n<li><strong>Sudden Insight</strong>. Here is your eureka moment! This is where your connections overflow until that fantastic &lsquo;aha&rsquo; moment hits.</li>\n<li><strong>Manifestation</strong>. In this stage you carry out and apply the sudden insight.</li>\n</ol><h2>We can cultivate creativity in numerous ways.</h2>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-584496\" src=\"http://cdn-media-2.lifehack.org/wp-content/files/2017/05/28053147/ideas-come-from.jpg\" width=\"688\" height=\"482\" data-lh-image-id=\"584496\" srcset=\"http://cdn-media-2.lifehack.org/wp-content/files/2017/05/28053147/ideas-come-from.jpg 688w, http://media.lifehack.org/wp-content/files/2017/05/28053147/ideas-come-from-380.jpg 380w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 688px) 100vw, 688px\"></p>\n<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Ask questions for which there are no answers.&rdquo;</p></blockquote>\n<p>There are certain things we can all do in order to become more creative. Let&rsquo;s look at some of them.</p>\n<ul><li><strong>Ask questions</strong>. &ldquo;Successful creators don&rsquo;t just like knowledge, they thirst for it. They can&rsquo;t stop asking question, and they always go beyond what they&rsquo;ve learned from teachers and books.&rdquo; &ndash; Keith Sawyer</li>\n<li><strong>Practice</strong>. When we practice a skill over and over again it will start to become a habit. Write about how to develop a creative mindset, blog about it, and even try to teach other people about it.</li>\n<li><strong>Use an analogy</strong>. When we use analogies, we find similarity between two things. Think of the index card example earlier.</li>\n<li><strong>Random word</strong>. If you have a problem and you need a completely outside-the-box approach to solving it&hellip; try this. Go to randomwordgenerator.com and generate a random word. Here the random word serves as a stimulus which will then serve as a bridge between the stimulus and the idea which will help you solve the problem.<sup id=\"footnote_plugin_tooltip_4803_3\" class=\"footnote_plugin_tooltip_text\" onclick=\"footnote_moveToAnchor('footnote_plugin_reference_4803_3');\">[3]</sup><span class=\"footnote_tooltip\" id=\"footnote_plugin_tooltip_text_4803_3\"></span></li>\n<li><strong>Leave your comfort zone</strong>. &ldquo;But the essence of creativity is to be surprised, to come up with something you really didn&rsquo;t know. That&rsquo;s the <em>nova </em>in innovation. It&rsquo;s the newness. And if you keep doing the same old thing, you won&rsquo;t do the new thing. But when you suspend the old thing, the new thing doesn&rsquo;t always automatically emerge.&rdquo; &ndash; Michael Gelb</li>\n<li><strong>Read poetry</strong>. Metacognition is when we think about what we are thinking about. This revelation recently hit me. The most powerful deep thinking approach is poetry.</li>\n<li><strong>Mind mapping</strong>. This is a great way to take a topic down a rabbit hole. This is where you have your main idea in the center. The main idea branches out to second and third-level branches. This will help you see patterns that others fail to see.</li>\n</ul><p>So, are you now motivated to become a creative thinker? Do you believe you can? Well, you should. On your journey to become a more creative thinker, remember the four stages and don&rsquo;t forget that you have to let your thoughts incubate for a while. Don&rsquo;t try to force the &lsquo;aha&rsquo; moment. Allow yourself the time to let your mind wander. Once you do this, you will find that you are able to create something out of nothing.</p><div class=\"footnote_container_prepare\">\t<h2>Reference</h2></div><div id=\"footnote_references_container\" style=\"\">\t<table class=\"footnote-reference-container\">\t\t<tbody>\t\t<tr>\t<td class=\"footnote_plugin_index\"><span id=\"footnote_plugin_reference_4803_1\">[1]</span></td>\t<td class=\"footnote_plugin_link\"><span onclick=\"footnote_moveToAnchor('footnote_plugin_tooltip_4803_1');\">^</span></td>\t<td class=\"footnote_plugin_text\"><a href=\"http://www.copyblogger.com/define-creativity/\" target=\"_blank\">Copyblogger: What is creativity? 21 authentic definitions you&rsquo;ll love</a></td></tr><tr>\t<td class=\"footnote_plugin_index\"><span id=\"footnote_plugin_reference_4803_2\">[2]</span></td>\t<td class=\"footnote_plugin_link\"><span onclick=\"footnote_moveToAnchor('footnote_plugin_tooltip_4803_2');\">^</span></td>\t<td class=\"footnote_plugin_text\"><a href=\"http://www.ybrikman.com/writing/2011/04/17/physical-analogy-for-creative-thought/\" target=\"_blank\">YBrikman: A physical analogy for the creative thought process)</a>)</p></blockquote>\n<p>Try the following with index cards, where each card has a word or phrase on it:</p>\n<ol><li>Shuffle the index cards.</li>\n<li>Drop them on the floor.</li>\n<li>Scan over the cards and see what sentences have formed from the random arrangement of words.</li>\n</ol><p>Brikman asserts, &ldquo;Most of the time, the random permutations will be meaningless.

In fact, they are divergent or lateral thinkers. They embrace a different way of thinking and attack problems from new angles. Creative people can literally remove their mind from the box. Typically, most people think that you must remain within the already known boundaries. However, when we move out of the box, we then extend our boundaries beyond the existing framework. This is critically important in cultivating creativity.</p>\n<h2>They act on the eureka moment.</h2>\n<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Seeing something that doesn&rsquo;t exist and then making it so.&rdquo; &ndash; Hugh Howey</p></blockquote>\n<p>Have you ever had that unbelievable epiphany or insight that just suddenly occurs in your mind? This is the eureka effect, our experience of suddenly comprehending something that was previously incomprehensible. The effect is named after a story about the ancient Greek mathematician Archimedes. However, we will use a different example of this effect. Sidney Harris has a simple cartoon that visualizes this effect perfectly. In her cartoon, she draws an illustration of Albert Einstein standing before a chalkboard. On the board, Einstein has two different equations crossed out. The title of the cartoon is the &ldquo;The Creative Moment&rdquo; and is a fabulous caricature of one of the most important discoveries in history.</p>\n<p>Creative thinkers endlessly search for their creative moment. So, the next time you have a eureka moment, use the following tips to act on it.</p>\n<h2>There are four stages of the creative process.</h2>\n<p>Let&rsquo;s now discuss how you can activate your creative mind by following these four stages.

Over the years, people have been known to use family and marriage counseling as a way to sort out issues which they are facing in their homes&nbsp;and to have a new breath and lease of life in their families. Although on the average, family counseling seems to be helpful, there are some that seem to be more effective than the other. However, before we share out top picks with you, here are some tips you should know about family counseling before you go into it.</p>\n<h2>Family Counseling Isn&rsquo;t a Substitute for Personal Activity</h2>\n<p>Basically, this means that although you&rsquo;ll get clarity and certain solutions through a family counseling effort, it still doesn&rsquo;t fill the void created by your inactivity and inability to do certain things. A family counseling effort will only tell you what to do. You&rsquo;ve still got to act by yourself and see things work. Otherwise, there&rsquo;s no reason why you should go into counseling in the first place.</p>\n<h2>It Doesn&rsquo;t Always Work</h2>\n<p>Although family counselors won&rsquo;t want to admit this, family counseling won&rsquo;t always work for you. This is because sometimes families have issues that family counseling just can&rsquo;t fix. These issues usually get ironed out by simple confrontations and self searching.<sup id=\"footnote_plugin_tooltip_8719_1\" class=\"footnote_plugin_tooltip_text\" onclick=\"footnote_moveToAnchor('footnote_plugin_reference_8719_1');\">[1]</sup><span class=\"footnote_tooltip\" id=\"footnote_plugin_tooltip_text_8719_1\"></span> So if you do go for a family counseling session and it seems not to be yielding any results, it&rsquo;s a pretty clear pointer that you&rsquo;re not necessarily in the right place.</p>\n<p>You should consider family counseling if you&rsquo;re experiencing any of the following:</p>\n<ul><li><strong>A prolonged feeling of sadness or helplessness about the issues facing your marriage and despite the efforts that you, your extended family and friends put in, things don&rsquo;t seem to get better</strong>. Basically, this means that counseling shouldn&rsquo;t be your first resort. You have to have put in a considerable amount of effort in trying to fix the problem before eventually resorting to family counseling.</li>\n<li><strong>A difficulty to carry out everyday activities, perhaps due to the stress being developed by your issues at home</strong>. At this point, seek help&hellip;..and FAST. You might be on the verge of a breakdown and that&rsquo;s way much worse.</li>\n<li><strong>You worry constantly</strong>. This is another marker towards a breakdown. At this point, you&rsquo;re more than free to consult a counselor.It shows that the issues are far more than you can stomach by yourself.</li>\n<li><strong>Actions at home are being harmful or injurious</strong>. Honestly, there is no clearer indicator to the fact that you need counseling more than this. Injurious actions include lashing out due to anger, excessive consumption of alcohol, drug use and abuse, a frequent occurrence of confrontations, disagreements and over aggressiveness. It&rsquo;s much better to seek out a counselor before things get out of hand because once they do, counseling might not be able to help you anymore.</li>\n</ul><p>Those being said, feel free to browse our top picks for family counseling services:</p>\n<h2><a href=\"http://www.goodtherapy.org/\" target=\"_blank\">Good Therapy</a>:&nbsp;helps you to find a therapist, psychologist, or marriage counselor near you</h2>\n<p>Good Therapy is nifty in the sense that they help search for qualified counselors and therapists who are able to help you navigate through problems in your marriage.

Saying the right words to someone when they are sick can be a difficult thing to do depending on your relationship with them. It can be a very tricky situation whether your relationship with them is professional or personal.</p>\n<p>Any time I get a word that someone close to me is sick, the first words that comes to mind &ndash; and eventually out of my mouth &ndash; is &ldquo;get well soon&rdquo;. It sounds clich&eacute; and lacks that sincere feel. It sounds too common. Not special.</p>\n<p>I always wonder if there&rsquo;s a better way to say that which I want to say without sounding odd &ndash; or even worse &ndash; to a sick friend. It can be embarrassing to utter the same words to different persons when they are sick.</p>\n<p>We have different emotional connections with different persons. It will be great to be able to express how much we miss them with the right words especially when they are down.</p>\n<p>If you are one of those who have the terrible habit of saying the wrong things when someone is sick, you&rsquo;re not alone. Almost everyone has experienced this before, and a lot of other people are still going to experience it.</p>\n<p>The reason is that we&rsquo;re never prepared for the worst &ndash; especially when someone is sick. We just don&rsquo;t want to think about it. And when it comes, we are thrown off our guard.</p>\n<p>Some people are so good with words that they always have the right things to say even during awkward times. These people always comes off as the cool ones. But, why can&rsquo;t we all be the cool? Why can&rsquo;t we all come out as being sensitive?</p>\n<p>This is a problem that needs to be solved. I found practical solutions to this. No, I wouldn&rsquo;t go on listing things to say. That is too rigid as we&rsquo;re are all unique.</p>\n<p>Rather, I&rsquo;ll tell you what to do that will make you say the right words no matter your relationship with them.</p>\n<p>So here&rsquo;s what I suggest&nbsp;what to say when someone is sick without sounding odd:</p>\n<h2><strong>Visit them and bring warmth to them</strong></h2>\n<p>Yeah. Visiting a sick person has a way of bringing out emotions from within you. This in turn will make comforting words flow out of your mouth. Words you never knew you could say.</p>\n<p>Your presence alone can make a huge difference when someone is sick. All feeling of awkwardness or oddness are gone. You&rsquo;ll connect on a level that you could ever imagine.</p>\n<p>You don&rsquo;t even have to buy flowers or cards if you&rsquo;re not up for it. Sometimes, we tend to overthink things, and end up not doing anything. When you arrive at the home of the sick person, endeavor to stay positive and don&rsquo;t dwell on negatives. You could open up conversation with phrases like: &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been thinking a lot about you&rdquo;, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s good to see you&rdquo;, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad I was able to visit you&rdquo;, etc.</p>\n<h2><strong>Listen to their words from heart</strong></h2>\n<p>One of the greatest gift you can give someone is to listen to them &ndash; even when they are not sick. Sometimes, when people are sick, they feel like pouring out their hearts to someone.</p>\n<p>It doesn&rsquo;t matter who that person is as long as they are there to listen. You should be there for them. During these moments, you don&rsquo;t have to say much. Just give them your full attention.</p>\n<p>This alone can bring out the best words, and emotions from within you &mdash; which can just be a smile or a nod.<br>\nIt is also ok to offer your help at this time. Just try to be specific on your offering. Avoid saying things like &ldquo;Let me know if there&rsquo;s any way I can help.&rdquo; They are more likely to respond if you say something like &ldquo;I will be over to your house on Sunday to cook your favorite dinner&rdquo;.</p>\n<h2><strong>Send a custom card to show how much they mean to you</strong></h2>\n<p>It&rsquo;s not just in the card, it&rsquo;s about making them know how much they mean to you. Avoid clich&eacute; words. Simple words like &ldquo;I miss you&rdquo; on a card will go a long way in showing that you care.</p>\n<p>There are many inspirations you can use. Try to be genuine and humorous. Here are two of some examples of get well soon messages I have used in the past.</p>\n<p>a. &ldquo;Here&rsquo;s a to-do list that I want you to make your priority:</p>\n<p>1. Get Well!</p>\n<p>2. There is nothing else on the list</p>\n<p>3. Seriously, just do number 1.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>b. &ldquo;If I told you to &lsquo;get well soon,&rsquo; it wouldn&rsquo;t be soon enough. Get well now!&rdquo;</p>\n<p>You can find more examples of this kind of <a href=\"https://letterpile.com/correspondence/Get-Well-Card-Messages-----What-To-Write-In-A-Card\" target=\"_blank\">message here</a></p>\n<p>These tips will help you in avoiding awkward situations when someone is sick especially when you don&rsquo;t know what to say. When you follow these tips, you don&rsquo;t even have to think about what to say, it comes to you naturally.</p><p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.lifehack.org/582895/what-say-when-someone-sick\">Apart From &#8220;Get Well Soon&#8221;, What Else Can You Say to People Who&#8217;re Sick?</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.lifehack.org\">Lifehack</a>.</p>",

Although you know a little about what you enjoy, want from life and what you want to achieve in future, you are still tortured by the episodes of loneliness. When you say, <em>I feel empty</em>, what does this mean exactly?</p>\n<h2>Inner emptiness is caused by lack of love.</h2>\n<p>According to Dr. Margaret Paul, the inner emptiness is a state of mind that is caused by lack of love. When you don&rsquo;t love yourself, ignore your feelings and always try to get attention and approval from others you can experience the inner emptiness.</p>\n<p>All people are creative and full of potential, but not all of them use this potential and thus waste their time and energy. Then we try to fill the void with food, relationships, work, and things that are supposed to distract our attention.</p>\n<h2>Understanding emptiness calls us to learn more about our inner feelings.</h2>\n<p>In order to find the solution to the problem, we should learn how to tell whether we&rsquo;re feeling empty inside. Let&rsquo;s have a look at the most common symptoms of emptiness and void:</p>\n<ul><li>You don&rsquo;t understand who you are and your purpose in life;</li>\n<li>You are full of negative thoughts;</li>\n<li>You always seek for approval from family and friends;</li>\n<li>You don&rsquo;t know how to explain your feelings.</li>\n</ul><h2>Sometimes emptiness feels like an inner void, vacuum or a black hole.</h2>\n<p>The most important thing to realize is that emptiness is a state of lack. I will tip you off to the fact that majority of people who struggle with a chronic sense of emptiness had parents who were incapable of intimate relationships with them. When you do not get enough love and attention in the childhood you start to believe that you are not good enough. That means that the real cause of inner emptiness is a lack of emotional connection and demonstration of love.<sup id=\"footnote_plugin_tooltip_1824_1\" class=\"footnote_plugin_tooltip_text\" onclick=\"footnote_moveToAnchor('footnote_plugin_reference_1824_1');\">[1]</sup><span class=\"footnote_tooltip\" id=\"footnote_plugin_tooltip_text_1824_1\"></span></p>\n<p>As a result, this feeling can travel through our lives like baggage. The lack of belonging becomes a traumatic imprint that becomes so acutely uncomfortable that we are willing to do anything we can to get away from that particular feeling.</p>\n<h2>The feeling of emptiness can lead to depression.</h2>\n<p>Although this feeling is not uncommon for many people, if left unattended, it can result in a chronic disorder such as depression. Furthermore, people tend to get out of this feeling with alcohol and drugs, which increases the chance of drug or alcohol addiction. That&rsquo;s why having a clue about what is really important to you will help to know what causes you to feel empty inside.</p>\n<h2>The key is to fighting emptiness is to find out what you are missing.</h2>\n<p>Is it a sense of belonging, meaning or interpersonal connection? Here are several suggestions from leading experts of how to recognize and deal with inner emptiness.</p>\n<h3>1. Refocus and rebalance yourself.</h3>\n<p>According to Kaitlyn Slight, a marriage and family therapist in Raleigh, N.C., we should focus on ourselves and spend more time thinking about our desires.<sup id=\"footnote_plugin_tooltip_1824_2\" class=\"footnote_plugin_tooltip_text\" onclick=\"footnote_moveToAnchor('footnote_plugin_reference_1824_2');\">[2]</sup><span class=\"footnote_tooltip\" id=\"footnote_plugin_tooltip_text_1824_2\"></span></p>\n<p>In order to be in a positive state of body and mind, you can spend several minutes meditating or exercising.</p>\n<p>The easiest way to rebalance yourself emotionally and physically is to take a warm bath.<sup id=\"footnote_plugin_tooltip_1824_3\" class=\"footnote_plugin_tooltip_text\" onclick=\"footnote_moveToAnchor('footnote_plugin_reference_1824_3');\">[3]</sup><span class=\"footnote_tooltip\" id=\"footnote_plugin_tooltip_text_1824_3\"></span>&nbsp;Many researches have shown that bathing has a lot of benefits including pain relief, enhanced mobility, and improved psychological well-being.<sup id=\"footnote_plugin_tooltip_1824_4\" class=\"footnote_plugin_tooltip_text\" onclick=\"footnote_moveToAnchor('footnote_plugin_reference_1824_4');\">[4]</sup><span class=\"footnote_tooltip\" id=\"footnote_plugin_tooltip_text_1824_4\"></span></p>\n<h3>2. Find your needs with the help of others.</h3>\n<p>Everybody has needs, but what makes the needs painful is when we think we cannot get what we need. We think that we have to meet them by ourselves, but sometimes it is important to take action to get up and find someone to meet the need. Asking for help can resolve many life issues and can be a first step towards meeting your needs. For example, if your need is for the company you don&rsquo;t have to spend your time to figure out how to be your own company. Just go find a company.</p>\n<h3>3. Appreciate and treasure what you have.</h3>\n<p>Another way to heal your inner emptiness is through gratitude. The research suggests that feeling grateful is a very important positive emotion that allows people to expand their worldview and the view of themselves, which later leads to building better social relations and skills.<sup id=\"footnote_plugin_tooltip_1824_5\" class=\"footnote_plugin_tooltip_text\" onclick=\"footnote_moveToAnchor('footnote_plugin_reference_1824_5');\">[5]</sup><span class=\"footnote_tooltip\" id=\"footnote_plugin_tooltip_text_1824_5\"></span></p>\n<p>This means that individuals who are thankful are also more satisfied with their relationships with friends and family as well as they are less stressed and much happier. Try to be appreciative for what is around you by noticing all good things we take for granted. A simple compliment given during the day will show you how much positive energy you can create.</p>\n<h3>4. Never stop exploring something new.</h3>\n<p>Neurobiologists have found out that learning something new has motivational effects similar to dopamine which leads to the emotional arousal.<sup id=\"footnote_plugin_tooltip_1824_6\" class=\"footnote_plugin_tooltip_text\" onclick=\"footnote_moveToAnchor('footnote_plugin_reference_1824_6');\">[6]</sup><span class=\"footnote_tooltip\" id=\"footnote_plugin_tooltip_text_1824_6\"></span> That&rsquo;s why each time you review the information you&rsquo;ve learned before, add a couple of new facts. Another good tip is to change your environment. Even such little things as changing lighting or temperature in your room can have a positive effect on your emotional state.</p>\n<h3>5. Ask for a professional help if needed.</h3>\n<p>Many people cannot identify the reason behind this feeling no matter how long they psychoanalyzed themselves and searched for a problem. The main thing is not to give up and find a good therapist who will help you to find the causations of the inner void from the past and bring them to the present moment so that you can become whole again.</p>\n<p>Finding the cause of inner emptiness can be a challenging and long process. But instead of distracting yourself by filling this emptiness with things like shopping, food, alcohol and drugs, you&rsquo;d better find out what makes you feel incomplete and regain your happiness.</p><div class=\"footnote_container_prepare\">\t<h2>Reference</h2></div><div id=\"footnote_references_container\" style=\"\">\t<table class=\"footnote-reference-container\">\t\t<tbody>\t\t<tr>\t<td class=\"footnote_plugin_index\"><span id=\"footnote_plugin_reference_1824_1\">[1]</span></td>\t<td class=\"footnote_plugin_link\"><span onclick=\"footnote_moveToAnchor('footnote_plugin_tooltip_1824_1');\">^</span></td>\t<td class=\"footnote_plugin_text\">Huffington Post:&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/margaret-paul-phd/inner-emptiness_b_869421.html\" target=\"_blank\">The Real Cause of Inner Emptiness (And What to Do About It)</a></td></tr><tr>\t<td class=\"footnote_plugin_index\"><span id=\"footnote_plugin_reference_1824_2\">[2]</span></td>\t<td class=\"footnote_plugin_link\"><span onclick=\"footnote_moveToAnchor('footnote_plugin_tooltip_1824_2');\">^</span></td>\t<td class=\"footnote_plugin_text\">PsychCentral: <a href=\"https://psychcentral.com/blog/archives/2015/07/14/when-you-feel-empty-what-it-means-what-to-do-2/\" target=\"_blank\">When You Feel Empty: What It Means &amp; What to Do</a></td></tr><tr>\t<td class=\"footnote_plugin_index\"><span id=\"footnote_plugin_reference_1824_3\">[3]</span></td>\t<td class=\"footnote_plugin_link\"><span onclick=\"footnote_moveToAnchor('footnote_plugin_tooltip_1824_3');\">^</span></td>\t<td class=\"footnote_plugin_text\">ArjoHuntleigh: <a href=\"http://www.arjohuntleigh.com/knowledge/hygiene/therapeutic-bathing/\" target=\"_blank\">Therapeutic benefit of a hot bath</a></td></tr><tr>\t<td class=\"footnote_plugin_index\"><span id=\"footnote_plugin_reference_1824_4\">[4]</span></td>\t<td class=\"footnote_plugin_link\"><span onclick=\"footnote_moveToAnchor('footnote_plugin_tooltip_1824_4');\">^</span></td>\t<td class=\"footnote_plugin_text\">Better Bathrooms:&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.betterbathrooms.com/blog/the-physiological-and-psychological-effects-of-bathing/\" target=\"_blank\">The physiological and psychological effects of bathing</a></td></tr><tr>\t<td class=\"footnote_plugin_index\"><span id=\"footnote_plugin_reference_1824_5\">[5]</span></td>\t<td class=\"footnote_plugin_link\"><span onclick=\"footnote_moveToAnchor('footnote_plugin_tooltip_1824_5');\">^</span></td>\t<td class=\"footnote_plugin_text\">Positive Psychology Program:&nbsp;<a href=\"https://positivepsychologyprogram.com/broaden-build-theory/\" target=\"_blank\">Broaden-and-Build Theory of Positive Emotions (+PDF)</a></td></tr><tr>\t<td class=\"footnote_plugin_index\"><span id=\"footnote_plugin_reference_1824_6\">[6]</span></td>\t<td class=\"footnote_plugin_link\"><span onclick=\"footnote_moveToAnchor('footnote_plugin_tooltip_1824_6');\">^</span></td>\t<td class=\"footnote_plugin_text\">Science Daily: <a href=\"https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2006/08/060826180547.htm\" target=\"_blank\">Pure Novelty Spurs The Brain</a></td></tr>\t\t</tbody>\t</table></div><script type=\"text/javascript\">\tfunction footnote_expand_reference_container() {\t\tjQuery(\"#footnote_references_container\").show();        jQuery(\"#footnote_reference_container_collapse_button\").text(\"-\");\t}    function footnote_collapse_reference_container() {        jQuery(\"#footnote_references_container\").hide();        jQuery(\"#footnote_reference_container_collapse_button\").text(\"+\");    }\tfunction footnote_expand_collapse_reference_container() {\t\tif (jQuery(\"#footnote_references_container\").is(\":hidden\")) {            footnote_expand_reference_container();\t\t} else {            footnote_collapse_reference_container();\t\t}\t}    function footnote_moveToAnchor(p_str_TargetID) {        footnote_expand_reference_container();        var l_obj_Target = jQuery(\"#\" + p_str_TargetID);        if(l_obj_Target.length) {            jQuery('html, body').animate({                scrollTop: l_obj_Target.offset().top - window.innerHeight/2            }, 1000);        }    }</script><p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.lifehack.org/582113/feel-empty-why-all-feel-empty-sometimes\">Why Do We All Feel Empty Sometimes</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.lifehack.org\">Lifehack</a>.</p>",

You&rsquo;ll undoubtedly recognize some of their names: Richard Branson, Warren Buffett, Tim Ferriss, Bill Gates and Sheryl Sandberg.</p>\n<h2>Why Is It so Hard to Connect with Top Business Mentors?</h2>\n<p>Imagine having someone as wise and experienced as a CEO of a Fortune 100 company advising you on your business.</p>\n<p>You&rsquo;d love it, right?</p>\n<p>But you&rsquo;ve probably never seriously considered it, as surely, they would never want to be your mentor?</p>\n<p>If you start of with the attitude above, then it&rsquo;s highly unlikely that you&rsquo;ll ever connect with a great mentor. Not only will you make no effort to contact possible mentors, but even if you did, it&rsquo;s odds-on that they&rsquo;ll immediately pick up on your lack of confidence and belief.</p>\n<p>The world&rsquo;s top business mentors are looking to help the next generation of entrepreneurs to succeed. These mentors are already super-rich, so money is no longer their main driver. In many cases, they just want to pass on their wisdom to help young businesses and entrepreneurs avoid common and unexpected pitfalls.</p>\n<p>As you&rsquo;ll see shortly, great business mentors are often open to helping people who have unique ideas, a burning passion and a clear purpose. If you have these traits, then put your doubts aside, as connecting with top business mentors may be easier than you believe.</p>\n<h2>A good mentor gives you advice that will grow you continuously.</h2>\n<p>Connecting with great mentors can help you and your business in an abundance of ways.</p>\n<p>A major benefit from mentorship is <strong>advice</strong>. For example, just think of how helpful it would be to call your mentor when you needed a second-opinion on an important business decision. Their advice could mean the difference between a good or bad decision (and a subsequent profit or loss).</p>\n<p>Another important benefit from mentorship is <strong>perspective</strong>. For instance, your mentor could look at a business problem you are having with fresh eyes &ndash; and from a whole new angle. Einstein said it well:</p>\n<blockquote><p>&ldquo;We can&rsquo;t solve problems by using the same kind of thinking we used when we created them.&rdquo;</p></blockquote>\n<p>Other benefits from mentorship include: <strong>encouragement</strong>, <strong>networking</strong>, and <strong>skills improvement</strong>.</p>\n<h2>These are the 7 steps for connecting with the best mentors in business.</h2>\n<p>Once you&rsquo;ve set your mind on finding a great mentor &ndash; you&rsquo;re ready to act on the steps below.</p>\n<h3>1. Create a dynamic profile of yourself and your business.</h3>\n<p>The first step towards attracting a top mentor is to make your online profile as presentable as possible. Let&rsquo;s say you regularly use LinkedIn and Twitter. Make sure that your profile on each of these sites powerfully projects your innovation and passion. This starts with having a professional, welcoming profile picture. From there, let readers quickly see your skills and experience. And finally, pay close attention to your posts and tweets. These should reflect your entrepreneurial spirit, and not be negative or offensive.</p>\n<h3>2. Search for mentors who match your requirements.</h3>\n<p>You may already have a few potential mentors in mind. That&rsquo;s a great place to start from. However, you&rsquo;ll likely be able to narrow your list down by studying each of the individuals and their interests. The aim is to ascertain which of the potential mentors would be the best match for you and your business. You can do this by: researching them on Google, looking at their latest posts and recommendations, studying their current business interests and investments.</p>\n<h3>3. Once you&rsquo;ve found a potential mentor &ndash; be on their radar.</h3>\n<p>Once you&rsquo;ve narrowed down your search to one or two potential mentors, then begin to interact with them. You can do this by replying to their tweets, sharing their Facebook posts, and commenting (in a meaningful way) on their blogs. To be clear, you&rsquo;re not trying to stalk them! Rather, you&rsquo;re simply trying to catch their attention before moving to step four&hellip;</p>\n<h3>4. Consider contacting them directly and asking for their help.</h3>\n<p>If you have a good understanding of your potential mentor(s), then you&rsquo;ll instinctively know when is the best time to reach out to them for help. If they&rsquo;ve already replied to your comments on social media, then you definitely have a foot in the door. Whether you contact them via email, or private messaging on Facebook, LinkedIn or Twitter, just be sure to mention some of their posts and blogs that you&rsquo;ve enjoyed and benefited from. This makes a great introduction. Next, give a brief and engaging overview of yourself and your business. Then ask politely for some advice or information from them.</p>\n<h3>5. Consider volunteering at an event they are speaking at.</h3>\n<p>Not all mentors are active on social media, so you may need to try alternative techniques for gaining their attention. One way to do this, is to find out when and where they will be speaking next. If it&rsquo;s in a convenient location for you, then contact the event organizers and often to volunteer your services. This could take the form of co-ordinating the event, or helping on the day. Either way, you&rsquo;ll be able to impress everyone with your enthusiasm and skills, and most importantly, you&rsquo;ll have an excellent chance of meeting and speaking with your potential mentor.</p>\n<h3>6. Put yourself into their shoes.</h3>\n<p>One trick you should definitely adopt when contacting a potential mentor, is to put yourself in their shoes. By this, I mean seeing the situation from their eyes. For instance, picture yourself as a great mentor such as Warren Buffett. Then look at your current self &ndash; and see if you would be interested in mentoring you! By adopting this fresh perspective you&rsquo;ll quickly see how to improve your pitch to your potential mentor. It can make a huge difference to your chances.</p>\n<h3>7. Be the perfect mentee.</h3>\n<p>To attract a great mentor, then you need to become the best mentee you possibly can. Do this by being open-minded, ready to learn, and respectful.

Although it&rsquo;s one of the symptoms, nausea doesn&rsquo;t always have to be affiliated with pregnancy. It can be <a href=\"http://www.thehealthsite.com/diseases-conditions/thirteen-causes-of-nausea-and-vomiting-you-should-know-about/\" target=\"_blank\">triggered by many other factors</a> such as food poisoning, alcohol, stress, eating disorders and stomach flu.</p>\n<p>The feeling of being rocked in a boat sounds better than it feels. When hit with nausea, the last thing on our minds is food or eating. We&rsquo;re afraid that it can make our stomachs feel even worse. Oftentimes though, its food that helps us recover.</p>\n<p>Whether your nausea is a symptom of pregnancy morning sickness, a side-effect of cancer treatment, motion sickness or just weather-induced, these can be treated with lifestyle changes and natural remedies. Although nausea isn&rsquo;t as serious as other symptoms, they can still impact our quality of life negatively.</p>\n<p>There are common remedies for this common problem:</p>\n<h2>1. Water</h2>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-587375\" src=\"http://cdn-media-2.lifehack.org/wp-content/files/2017/05/04012042/water-glass-theme-water-16490.jpg\" width=\"100%\" data-lh-image-id=\"587375\" srcset=\"http://cdn-media-2.lifehack.org/wp-content/files/2017/05/04012042/water-glass-theme-water-16490.jpg 940w, http://media.lifehack.org/wp-content/files/2017/05/04012042/water-glass-theme-water-16490-768.jpg 768w, http://media.lifehack.org/wp-content/files/2017/05/04012042/water-glass-theme-water-16490-380.jpg 380w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 940px) 100vw, 940px\"></p>\n<p>Queasy or not, water is an important part of our daily life. Staying hydrated is an unspoken requirement for everyone regardless of health status. Lack of liquids in our system will automatically result to dehydration which often leads to nausea. Settle your stomach with a cool glass of water in sips &ndash; or all the way down.</p>\n<h2>2. Nuts</h2>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-586406\" src=\"http://cdn-media-2.lifehack.org/wp-content/files/2017/05/02053601/juan-jose-valencia-antia-161381.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"4272\" height=\"2848\" data-lh-image-id=\"586406\" srcset=\"http://cdn-media-2.lifehack.org/wp-content/files/2017/05/02053601/juan-jose-valencia-antia-161381.jpg 4272w, http://media.lifehack.org/wp-content/files/2017/05/02053601/juan-jose-valencia-antia-161381-1024.jpg 1024w, http://media.lifehack.org/wp-content/files/2017/05/02053601/juan-jose-valencia-antia-161381-768.jpg 768w, http://media.lifehack.org/wp-content/files/2017/05/02053601/juan-jose-valencia-antia-161381-380.jpg 380w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 4272px) 100vw, 4272px\"></p>\n<p>Nausea is even worse when you lack protein. Restore your energy levels by getting some pistachios, almonds and peanuts in your system. You can even go for doses of peanut butter. However, if you have a peanut allergy, avoid nuts at all costs.</p>\n<h2>3. Banana</h2>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-586390\" src=\"http://cdn-media-2.lifehack.org/wp-content/files/2017/05/02052149/bananas.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"650\" height=\"502\" data-lh-image-id=\"586390\" srcset=\"http://cdn-media-2.lifehack.org/wp-content/files/2017/05/02052149/bananas.jpg 650w, http://media.lifehack.org/wp-content/files/2017/05/02052149/bananas-380.jpg 380w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 650px) 100vw, 650px\"></p>\n<p>Fruits are a no-brainer when it comes to food to eat when nauseous. Just look at how vigorous the minions are because of bananas. On a more serious note, as another source of potassium, bananas can immediately help mitigate dehydration and vomiting. Bananas are usually the food recommended to help you ease back into eating solids again.</p>\n<h2>4. Apple</h2>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-587378\" src=\"http://cdn-media-2.lifehack.org/wp-content/files/2017/05/04012134/apple-red-fruit-ripe-144245.jpeg\" width=\"100%\" data-lh-image-id=\"587378\" srcset=\"http://cdn-media-2.lifehack.org/wp-content/files/2017/05/04012134/apple-red-fruit-ripe-144245.jpeg 940w, http://media.lifehack.org/wp-content/files/2017/05/04012134/apple-red-fruit-ripe-144245-768.jpeg 768w, http://media.lifehack.org/wp-content/files/2017/05/04012134/apple-red-fruit-ripe-144245-380.jpeg 380w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 940px) 100vw, 940px\"></p>\n<p>Apples are rich in fiber and helps in flushing out nausea-inducing chemicals in our system. But like everything else, eat it in moderation. Go by the &ldquo;an apple a day, keeps the doctor away&rdquo; mindset. It can also be eaten in the form of applesauce, apple juice if digesting solid food requires too much effort. Apple cider vinegar can also help; just mix a teaspoon of it with honey in a cup of water, then drink this at least four times daily.</p>\n<h2>5. Crackers</h2>\n<p><img class=\"size-full wp-image-587313\" src=\"http://cdn-media-2.lifehack.org/wp-content/files/2017/05/03233140/Saltine-Crackers.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"3438\" height=\"1515\" data-lh-image-id=\"587313\" srcset=\"http://cdn-media-2.lifehack.org/wp-content/files/2017/05/03233140/Saltine-Crackers.jpg 3438w, http://media.lifehack.org/wp-content/files/2017/05/03233140/Saltine-Crackers-1024.jpg 1024w, http://media.lifehack.org/wp-content/files/2017/05/03233140/Saltine-Crackers-768.jpg 768w, http://media.lifehack.org/wp-content/files/2017/05/03233140/Saltine-Crackers-380.jpg 380w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 3438px) 100vw, 3438px\"></p>\n<p>Bits and pieces of bread, toast, saltine crackers are instant relievers. These are high in starch and help absorb stomach acid and eases queasy stomachs. It is best eaten in the morning before you start your day. Keep this close by for times when the churning in your stomach becomes uncontrollable.</p>\n<h2>6. Ginger</h2>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-587379\" src=\"http://cdn-media-2.lifehack.org/wp-content/files/2017/05/04012200/ginger-plant-asia-rhizome-161556.jpeg\" width=\"100%\" data-lh-image-id=\"587379\" srcset=\"http://cdn-media-2.lifehack.org/wp-content/files/2017/05/04012200/ginger-plant-asia-rhizome-161556.jpeg 940w, http://media.lifehack.org/wp-content/files/2017/05/04012200/ginger-plant-asia-rhizome-161556-768.jpeg 768w, http://media.lifehack.org/wp-content/files/2017/05/04012200/ginger-plant-asia-rhizome-161556-380.jpeg 380w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 940px) 100vw, 940px\"></p>\n<p>Ginger can be eaten in the powder form, grated, as ginger ale, ginger tea, gingersnap cookies, ginger candy and pickled ginger. Healthcare professionals also frequently recommend ginger for treating nausea and vomiting brought about by pregnancy or chemotherapy. Ginger <a href=\"https://www.natureword.com/foods-to-eat-for-nausea/\" target=\"_blank\">contains absorbent, antispasmodic and antiemetic</a> properties. This is one of the best remedies for travel sickness. Consume it in moderate amounts though. Too much of it can irritate the stomach lining</p>\n<h2>7. Citrus</h2>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-587380\" src=\"http://cdn-media-2.lifehack.org/wp-content/files/2017/05/04012217/pexels-photo-96620.jpeg\" width=\"100%\" data-lh-image-id=\"587380\" srcset=\"http://cdn-media-2.lifehack.org/wp-content/files/2017/05/04012217/pexels-photo-96620.jpeg 940w, http://media.lifehack.org/wp-content/files/2017/05/04012217/pexels-photo-96620-768.jpeg 768w, http://media.lifehack.org/wp-content/files/2017/05/04012217/pexels-photo-96620-380.jpeg 380w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 940px) 100vw, 940px\"></p>\n<p>Whether you prefer lemons or oranges, infuse them in your water, suck on the slices, or juice them. There&rsquo;s nothing freshly juiced fruit can&rsquo;t fix. A popular home remedy also suggests sipping on boiled lemon peels and honey.</p>\n<h2>8. Dark Chocolate</h2>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-587383\" src=\"http://cdn-media-2.lifehack.org/wp-content/files/2017/05/04012254/pexels-photo-94439.jpeg\" width=\"100%\" data-lh-image-id=\"587383\" srcset=\"http://cdn-media-2.lifehack.org/wp-content/files/2017/05/04012254/pexels-photo-94439.jpeg 940w, http://media.lifehack.org/wp-content/files/2017/05/04012254/pexels-photo-94439-768.jpeg 768w, http://media.lifehack.org/wp-content/files/2017/05/04012254/pexels-photo-94439-380.jpeg 380w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 940px) 100vw, 940px\"></p>\n<p>This is probably a favorite on the list no matter your age. Taking a bite of dark chocolate is like killing two birds with one stone. You get rid of your nausea AND your sweet tooth is satisfied.</p>\n<h2>9. Sports Drinks</h2>\n<p><img class=\"size-full wp-image-587374\" src=\"http://cdn-media-2.lifehack.org/wp-content/files/2017/05/04011751/gatorade1.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"980\" height=\"515\" data-lh-image-id=\"587374\" srcset=\"http://cdn-media-2.lifehack.org/wp-content/files/2017/05/04011751/gatorade1.jpg 980w, http://media.lifehack.org/wp-content/files/2017/05/04011751/gatorade1-768.jpg 768w, http://media.lifehack.org/wp-content/files/2017/05/04011751/gatorade1-380.jpg 380w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 980px) 100vw, 980px\"></p>\n<p>I admit that I only used to drink Gatorade for its cool colors and taste. It turns out sports drinks contain potassium and electrolytes both of which help restore the nutrients we lack. You don&rsquo;t have to come fresh from a workout or be an athlete to get a dose of this.</p>\n<h2>10. Peppermint</h2>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-587382\" src=\"http://cdn-media-2.lifehack.org/wp-content/files/2017/05/04012239/herbal-tea-herbs-tee-mint-159203.jpeg\" width=\"100%\" data-lh-image-id=\"587382\" srcset=\"http://cdn-media-2.lifehack.org/wp-content/files/2017/05/04012239/herbal-tea-herbs-tee-mint-159203.jpeg 940w, http://media.lifehack.org/wp-content/files/2017/05/04012239/herbal-tea-herbs-tee-mint-159203-768.jpeg 768w, http://media.lifehack.org/wp-content/files/2017/05/04012239/herbal-tea-herbs-tee-mint-159203-380.jpeg 380w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 940px) 100vw, 940px\"></p>\n<p>The smell alone can immediately alleviate any traces of dizziness. You also have the option of chewing on the actual leaves or drinking it as a tea. Feel free to add its leaves to drinking water and juice as well.</p>\n<h2>So In general, you have to avoid foods that are too strong to handle.</h2>\n<p>Did you notice how most of these are bland, have a soft texture and have almost little or no smell at all? The last thing we want is to deal with odors our systems find too strong to handle.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.livestrong.com/article/340191-foods-to-avoid-for-nausea/\" target=\"_blank\">Avoid acidic fruit</a>, foods that are fried, fatty, greasy and spicy and (literally) hot. For those who are lactose intolerant, dairy products are also a no-no. Not all these are guaranteed to soothe the discomfort you feel. We all react differently when it comes to food.</p>\n<p>Sometimes, there&rsquo;s nothing we can do to force ourselves to eat. In cases like this, <a href=\"https://gottru.com/essential-oils-do-i-need-them/\" target=\"_blank\">aromatherapy can also help</a> in easing nausea. Dabbing a little peppermint oil onto our tummies or inhaling it can immediately soothe an upset stomach.</p>\n<p>Give these items a few trial and error runs and determine which one will cooperate with your stomach best. <em>If all else fails, a positive state of mind and fresh air will always do you some good. </em></p>\n<p><span class=\"credit\">Featured photo credit: <a href=\"https://www.pexels.com/photo/food-healthy-vegetables-potatoes-5205\" target=\"_blank\">Pexels via pexels.com</a></span></p><p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.lifehack.org/586343/sickness-relief-top-10-foods-eat-when-you-feel-nauseous\">Sickness Relief: Top 10 Foods To Eat When You Feel Nauseous</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.lifehack.org\">Lifehack</a>.</p>",

The truth is that people don&rsquo;t leave jobs, they leave one organization to another. Knowing this, organisations have put in place mechanisms that allow them to hear the perspective of their outgoing staff. This allows them to receive meaningful and progressive feedback from their outgoing staff. In addition, it builds in the employee the sense that the organisation cares.</p>\n<p>Organisations and employer of labor will have to deal with losing an employee at some point. This moment calls for both parties to reflect on their time together rather than focus only on benefit and off-boarding matters. However, for the outgoing staff, it&rsquo;s important that you are aware of this phase as you prepare to leave an organisation. Here are 10 most common question you will be asked when you quit your job:</p>\n<h2>1. What do you want from your job, career and life?</h2>\n<p>This is one of the most common questions in an exit interview. It is an indirect way for the employees to know why you are leaving. Your fulfilment on a job depends on what you yearn for from your, job, life and career. The employer wants to know if your current job lacks the things needed to fulfil your deep aspirations. There are no right or wrong answers to this question. The most important thing is to be open and honest in revealing what you really want out of your job or career. Use this opportunity to talk about your deep motivation. A good example might be:</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Learning new things has always been a great motivator for me. I like having a job that provides me with the opportunity to learn something new or a new way to look at a problem.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>What you don&rsquo;t want to do is associating your response to your personal issues like the desire to pay off credit card debts or student loans.</p>\n<h2>2. Where are you going?</h2>\n<p>Quitting your current job implies that you have an alternative to rely on. So, don&rsquo;t be surprised if this is one of the questions that comes up in your exit interview. You need to be ready with an answer to this question before you head for the exit interview. Your current employer may like to know where you are going to have an insight into your reason for quitting. Are you quitting your current job for a higher paying one or you want to go float your company? The answer to this question will be generic depending on the reason behind decision to quit. However, it is important for you to be truthful with your response. Giving an honest answer might help the employer improve their approach to employees.</p>\n<h2>3. Why did you accept the new job?</h2>\n<p>Your employer knows that you are leaving them for another company and you have a right to do so. Letting your employer know the biggest reason for accepting your new job will help them measure how well they are doing against other companies. You have the right to withhold your reasons. However, telling your boss the real reason will help them know how well they are doing and things that might need improvement.</p>\n<h2>4. What qualities should we look out for in your replacement?</h2>\n<p>No one knows your job like you do, so don&rsquo;t be surprised if a question like this comes up in your exit interview. Feel free to tell your HR some of the factors to look for in your replacement. This will help your company hire a replacement that fits the role. An honest answer will also indicate you still have their best interest at heart as well.</p>\n<h2>5. Were you able to share your challenges with your manager?</h2>\n<p>This question is helpful in evaluating the interpersonal relation skill of the manger. It could further help the organisation put in place professional development training for the manager. In my opinion, I will recommend an honest answer to avoid a repetition of poor manager to employee relationship.</p>\n<h2>6. What five things you will like to see in this organization?</h2>\n<p>In most cases, employee and manager mismatch have been the common reasons why employee leave a job. If this is not the reason the employee is leaving, there is always room for improvement. The organisation always wants a prioritized feedback from their employee by asking them to name five things they will like to see. In doing so, they can tap into the core perspective of the employee about the organisation. I will employ an honest answer from the employee at this point because it&rsquo;s all about improving the workplace for another person who could be our friend.</p>\n<h2>7. Were you updated on new developments in the company?</h2>\n<p>Transparency is an important element at the work place and its endearing to the millennia&rsquo;s. This is an opportunity for the organisation to know how you rate them when it comes to open door policy at the workplace. They want to know if transparency shone from the management team to the employee or you as an employee felt left out. I felt left out on my previous job and in most cases, I never knew what the company was up to. The answer to this question will help the organisation review their policy and perhaps is one of the reasons you are losing the best staff. This is an opportunity to let the organisation know are inclusive their policy is.</p>\n<h2>8. Were you giving the resources to perform your task?</h2>\n<p>The productivity of an organisation lies in the quality of its staff. Every organisation values a productive work force. However, cases may arise when an employee was not adequately equipped for the role there by resulting in low productivity. Find out what the organisation is doing right or wrong in terms of providing necessary support for their staff is crucial. This will help them note an area that needs improvement. Perhaps more training courses or supervision will be needed in the subsequent situation. This is an opportunity to recommend training, tools and suggestion on how their resource pool can be improved.</p>\n<h2>9. What were the good and bad moments?</h2>\n<p>This question can help understand some of the challenges your employees are facing while on the job. It can also point to what makes them feel successful. Perhaps the organisation is to strict or non-evolving and missing the mark.

What did you like about the organisation?</h2>\n<p>It is also important for an organisation to note what they are doing well. What the employees like about them. These are things and organisation should build upon and fortify in its policy.

It is imperative to give a feedback on the good things the organisation is doing well so that they can continue to build on it.</p><p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.lifehack.org/585242/exit-interview-questions\">Get Prepared for These Questions When You Quit Your Job, or You May Get into Trouble</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.lifehack.org\">Lifehack</a>.</p>",

Is it possible for us to improve our persuasion skills? Yes, you just need to master this technique: syllogistic reasoning. <sup id=\"footnote_plugin_tooltip_7057_1\" class=\"footnote_plugin_tooltip_text\" onclick=\"footnote_moveToAnchor('footnote_plugin_reference_7057_1');\">[1]</sup><span class=\"footnote_tooltip\" id=\"footnote_plugin_tooltip_text_7057_1\"></span></p>\n<p>Let&rsquo;s now take a look at how this technique works and how you can apply it in daily life.</p>\n<h2>What Exactly Is Syllogistic Reasoning?</h2>\n<p>Syllogistic reasoning is a form of deductive reasoning. If we look at the difference between deductive and inductive reasoning, we can see how the approach is flipped. Let&rsquo;s compare this by way of an analogy. Inductive reasoning is much like an artistic painter who combines various colors together to form a painting. By contrast, deductive reasoning is like a sculptor removing material until the artist reveals what she wishes to portray.&rdquo; <sup id=\"footnote_plugin_tooltip_7057_2\" class=\"footnote_plugin_tooltip_text\" onclick=\"footnote_moveToAnchor('footnote_plugin_reference_7057_2');\">[2]</sup><span class=\"footnote_tooltip\" id=\"footnote_plugin_tooltip_text_7057_2\"></span></p>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-586445\" src=\"http://cdn-media-2.lifehack.org/wp-content/files/2017/05/02060218/inductive-reasoning1.jpg\" width=\"100%\" data-lh-image-id=\"586445\" srcset=\"http://cdn-media-2.lifehack.org/wp-content/files/2017/05/02060218/inductive-reasoning1.jpg 600w, http://media.lifehack.org/wp-content/files/2017/05/02060218/inductive-reasoning1-380.jpg 380w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px\"></p>\n<p>So, what exactly is syllogistic reasoning?</p>\n<p><strong>Syllogistic Reasoning</strong> means the use of syllogisms to deduce arguments that draw conclusions from two premises&ndash;a major one and a minor one. <sup id=\"footnote_plugin_tooltip_7057_3\" class=\"footnote_plugin_tooltip_text\" onclick=\"footnote_moveToAnchor('footnote_plugin_reference_7057_3');\">[3]</sup><span class=\"footnote_tooltip\" id=\"footnote_plugin_tooltip_text_7057_3\"></span></p>\n<p>Here&rsquo;s an example of Aristotle&rsquo;s Syllogism:</p>\n<ul><li>All humans are animals.</li>\n<li>All animals are mortal.</li>\n<li>Therefore, all humans are mortal.</li>\n</ul><p>In this example, we have a logical argument in which a pair of sentences serve as the premises, where the third sentence is the conclusion. A syllogism can be labeled as valid if the premises are true, where it would follow that the conclusion is also true. <sup id=\"footnote_plugin_tooltip_7057_4\" class=\"footnote_plugin_tooltip_text\" onclick=\"footnote_moveToAnchor('footnote_plugin_reference_7057_4');\">[4]</sup><span class=\"footnote_tooltip\" id=\"footnote_plugin_tooltip_text_7057_4\"></span></p>\n<h2>How Mastering Syllogistic Reasoning Will Benefit You A Lot</h2>\n<ul><li><strong>Intelligence</strong>. In a 2011 study, researchers found a close association between syllogistic reasoning and intelligence. They found that syllogistic reasoning is key to our IQ. <sup id=\"footnote_plugin_tooltip_7057_5\" class=\"footnote_plugin_tooltip_text\" onclick=\"footnote_moveToAnchor('footnote_plugin_reference_7057_5');\">[5]</sup><span class=\"footnote_tooltip\" id=\"footnote_plugin_tooltip_text_7057_5\"></span></li>\n<li><strong>Objectivity</strong>. Researchers and mathematicians typically use syllogistic or deductive reasoning when testing whether a principle is true or not. The scientific method uses deduction to test hypotheses and theories. This provides them the advantage of objectivity and certainty. For example, when we say, &ldquo;If X, then Y&rdquo; demonstrates that Y is true if X is true. <sup id=\"footnote_plugin_tooltip_7057_6\" class=\"footnote_plugin_tooltip_text\" onclick=\"footnote_moveToAnchor('footnote_plugin_reference_7057_6');\">[6]</sup><span class=\"footnote_tooltip\" id=\"footnote_plugin_tooltip_text_7057_6\"></span></li>\n<li><strong>Not affected by new premises</strong>. In an inductive argument, when you find new evidence (premises) the argument is affected, where a deductive argument is not. Let&rsquo;s look at an example. <sup id=\"footnote_plugin_tooltip_7057_7\" class=\"footnote_plugin_tooltip_text\" onclick=\"footnote_moveToAnchor('footnote_plugin_reference_7057_7');\">[7]</sup><span class=\"footnote_tooltip\" id=\"footnote_plugin_tooltip_text_7057_7\"></span></li>\n</ul><ul><li>&ldquo;Today, John said he likes Romona. So, John likes Romona today.&rdquo; However, this statement is radically changed when we add a new premise. &ldquo;John told Felipe today that he didn&rsquo;t really like Romona.&rdquo;</li>\n</ul><h2>But Beware of the Loopholes in Syllogistic Reasoning As Well&hellip;</h2>\n<ul><li><strong>Syllogistic fallacies</strong>. One of the advantages to syllogistic reasoning was objectivity. Recall the statement, &ldquo;If X, then Y.&rdquo; But what happens if X is not true? The following illustration demonstrates this perfectly.</li>\n</ul><p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-586496\" src=\"http://cdn-media-2.lifehack.org/wp-content/files/2017/05/02065125/negative-se.jpg\" width=\"212\" height=\"238\" data-lh-image-id=\"586496\"></p>\n<ul><li><strong>Affirming the consequent</strong>. This is one of Aristotle&rsquo;s 13 fallacies and is defined by assuming an &ldquo;If Then&rdquo; statement is commutative. Think in terms of mathematics, where one term operating on a second is equal to the second operating on the first (a x b = b x a). Here is an example: I am in London, England. I am in England, therefore I am in London. <sup id=\"footnote_plugin_tooltip_7057_8\" class=\"footnote_plugin_tooltip_text\" onclick=\"footnote_moveToAnchor('footnote_plugin_reference_7057_8');\">[8]</sup><span class=\"footnote_tooltip\" id=\"footnote_plugin_tooltip_text_7057_8\"></span></li>\n</ul><h2>3 More Techniques to Improve Your Persuasion Skills</h2>\n<p><strong>Use the Priming Technique</strong></p>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-586732\" src=\"http://cdn-media-2.lifehack.org/wp-content/files/2017/05/03075340/Priming-example-300x123.gif1_.gif\" width=\"485\" height=\"199\" data-lh-image-id=\"586732\" srcset=\"http://cdn-media-2.lifehack.org/wp-content/files/2017/05/03075340/Priming-example-300x123.gif1_.gif 485w, http://media.lifehack.org/wp-content/files/2017/05/03075340/Priming-example-300x123.gif1_-380.gif 380w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 485px) 100vw, 485px\"></p>\n<p>Priming is described as a stimulus influencing a person&rsquo;s future thoughts and actions. In essence, priming will either introduce something new or bring an old thought back to the surface of our subconscious. Here are three ways to use this technique: <sup id=\"footnote_plugin_tooltip_7057_9\" class=\"footnote_plugin_tooltip_text\" onclick=\"footnote_moveToAnchor('footnote_plugin_reference_7057_9');\">[9]</sup><span class=\"footnote_tooltip\" id=\"footnote_plugin_tooltip_text_7057_9\"></span></p>\n<ol><li>Be subtle with priming. Attempt to influence another person toward a desired outcome without them realizing it.</li>\n<li>When a thought pops into your mind out of nowhere during a conversation, try to think back to what triggered that thought. Did the other person use this technique against you?</li>\n<li>Use images if you have an implicit idea of what something should look like. Images can be used to help prime user actions. Essentially, we can draw something from nearly nothing because we have an idea of what it is. <sup id=\"footnote_plugin_tooltip_7057_10\" class=\"footnote_plugin_tooltip_text\" onclick=\"footnote_moveToAnchor('footnote_plugin_reference_7057_10');\">[10]</sup><span class=\"footnote_tooltip\" id=\"footnote_plugin_tooltip_text_7057_10\"></span></li>\n</ol><p><strong>Anchoring and Adjustment Heuristic</strong></p>\n<p>Typically, we will base our decisions on known anchors (familiar positions). Adjustments will then be made using the anchor as the starting point. You can use this in two ways. <sup id=\"footnote_plugin_tooltip_7057_11\" class=\"footnote_plugin_tooltip_text\" onclick=\"footnote_moveToAnchor('footnote_plugin_reference_7057_11');\">[11]</sup><span class=\"footnote_tooltip\" id=\"footnote_plugin_tooltip_text_7057_11\"></span></p>\n<ol><li>When negotiating, suggest the condition (or price). The &lsquo;other party&rsquo; will typically base their counter relative to this condition (your anchor). Make sure you list your top choice first if you have to offer alternatives.</li>\n<li>Don&rsquo;t fall victim to this if you are the &lsquo;other party&rsquo;. When they suggest a price (or condition), do not simply assume it is close to their actual price.</li>\n</ol><p><strong>Understanding Theory of Mind (ToM)</strong></p>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-586724\" src=\"http://cdn-media-2.lifehack.org/wp-content/files/2017/05/03073030/ToM1.jpg\" width=\"400\" height=\"299\" data-lh-image-id=\"586724\" srcset=\"http://cdn-media-2.lifehack.org/wp-content/files/2017/05/03073030/ToM1.jpg 400w, http://media.lifehack.org/wp-content/files/2017/05/03073030/ToM1-380.jpg 380w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px\"></p>\n<p>We form theories about the beliefs, values, and motivations of other people when interacting with (or thinking about) them. Typically, we make conjectures as to what they are feeling and thinking. In essence, we attempt to predict the intent of others. This is the Theory of Mind. Let&rsquo;s look at the following example from Dr. Ashutosh Ratnam. <sup id=\"footnote_plugin_tooltip_7057_12\" class=\"footnote_plugin_tooltip_text\" onclick=\"footnote_moveToAnchor('footnote_plugin_reference_7057_12');\">[12]</sup><span class=\"footnote_tooltip\" id=\"footnote_plugin_tooltip_text_7057_12\"></span></p>\n<ul><li><strong>Misunderstanding (Glove</strong>). A burglar who has just robbed a shop is making his getaway. As he is running home, a policeman on his beat sees him drop his glove. <strong>Key point:</strong> He doesn&rsquo;t know the man is a burglar, he just wants to tell him he dropped his glove. But when the policeman shouts out to the burglar, &ldquo;Hey you, Stop!&rdquo;, the burglar turns around, sees the policeman and gives himself up. He puts his hands up and admits that he did the break-in at the local shop.</li>\n</ul><p>Let&rsquo;s look at two ways to use this to our advantage. <sup id=\"footnote_plugin_tooltip_7057_13\" class=\"footnote_plugin_tooltip_text\" onclick=\"footnote_moveToAnchor('footnote_plugin_reference_7057_13');\">[13]</sup><span class=\"footnote_tooltip\" id=\"footnote_plugin_tooltip_text_7057_13\"></span></p>\n<ol><li>Recognize that our thoughts about what other people are thinking are simply thoughts. We can never know for certain what another person is actually thinking. So, make sure to test your assumptions prior to reacting.</li>\n<li>If someone has falsely judged you or created a false impression of who you are, ask them to describe their impression of you. See if you can pinpoint where this false impression originated.</li>\n</ol><p>The most important piece of advice for improving your persuasion skills is to remain calm and keep a proper perspective at all times. We become vulnerable when we are emotional. Conversely, you can use emotion to your advantage. Think of a pinball machine where the player becomes frustrated and physically starts tilting the machine attempting to guide the pinball toward the flippers. In essence, strive to use a poker term referred to as &ldquo;Tilt&rdquo; and confuse your adversary. You will notice they will start using less than optimal strategies when they are angry and emotional.</p>\n<p>In the end, always keep a proper perspective.</p>\n<blockquote><p>&ldquo;If you change the

However veterans can find benefits with programs that help them become appreciative of their environment and its loved ones.<sup id=\"footnote_plugin_tooltip_8597_1\" class=\"footnote_plugin_tooltip_text\" onclick=\"footnote_moveToAnchor('footnote_plugin_reference_8597_1');\">[1]</sup><span class=\"footnote_tooltip\" id=\"footnote_plugin_tooltip_text_8597_1\"></span></p>\n<p>At the end of the day, couples should know that much could be salvaged depending on the multitude of considerations that the two persons in the relationship bring to counseling. Some of the qualities that could make couples counseling is empathy, being commitment-oriented, integrity and honesty, flexibility, humility, basic intelligence, maturity, mental balance and being concerned about the other person as much as you care about yourself. You may not have many of these characteristics but working on these qualities now could help you make the most of couples counseling.</p>\n<p>Here are some ways couples counseling can help saving a relationship.</p>\n<h2>Explore a problem from a new perspective</h2>\n<p>If couples are motivated enough, they can start looking and exploring the reason for their failures in the relationship with a new perspective. It is indeed a more insightful and expansive process when couples can look at a problem with a fresh viewpoint rather than being rigid about it. Most times enrolling for couples counseling shows a couple is willing to work through their problems. And couples counseling would give them that new angle to find solutions rather than be stuck with problems.</p>\n<h2>Be able to make hard choices or decisions</h2>\n<p>During couple counseling, couples can make those hard choices of wanting to make the relationship work or not.<sup id=\"footnote_plugin_tooltip_8597_2\" class=\"footnote_plugin_tooltip_text\" onclick=\"footnote_moveToAnchor('footnote_plugin_reference_8597_2');\">[2]</sup><span class=\"footnote_tooltip\" id=\"footnote_plugin_tooltip_text_8597_2\"></span> Certainly there is a renewed commitment or clarification of why a couple would want to make the relationship work again. Most times couples would want to go forward and save what relationship they have.</p>\n<h2>Improve communication between partners</h2>\n<p>Interactions could become poor in a relationship. Quality communication between partners is eroded when disputes occur. Such times could cause couples to reach a stalemate and distort their opinion of each other. Most times they lose the ability to be more trusting of each other and their weaknesses become exposed. However couples counseling could better their communication with each other and let them express their feelings more openly. They have an avenue to express how they truly feel.</p>\n<h2>Resolve conflicts in new ways</h2>\n<p>Couple counseling makes couples discover and find new ways to resolve conflicts. It can be hard to recognize conflicts or its causes and how to go about them. But a therapist will certainly provide tools necessary in dealing with difficult issues. You learn something you may never have known previously in handling critical situations.</p>\n<h2>Find a ground to expunge your disappointment or frustration</h2>\n<p>Of course we may be carrying &ldquo;baggage&rdquo; in a relationship, this we may not even be aware of. And such baggage would cause further harm in subsequent disputes. Couples counseling will always provide a &ldquo;neutral territory&rdquo; for couples to discuss and work through difficult issues. Such &ldquo;baggage&rdquo; could be what stops you from moving on in a relationship, but this is discussed and worked out.</p>\n<p>You should understand that couples counseling takes hard work, determination, and a desire to take one for the team. It is not for the immature or unprepared. It comes down to the willingness and the desire to do anything to save your relationship and be progressive about it.</p><div class=\"footnote_container_prepare\">\t<h2>Reference</h2></div><div id=\"footnote_references_container\" style=\"\">\t<table class=\"footnote-reference-container\">\t\t<tbody>\t\t<tr>\t<td class=\"footnote_plugin_index\"><span id=\"footnote_plugin_reference_8597_1\">[1]</span></td>\t<td class=\"footnote_plugin_link\"><span onclick=\"footnote_moveToAnchor('footnote_plugin_tooltip_8597_1');\">^</span></td>\t<td class=\"footnote_plugin_text\">Senior Veterans Care:&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.seniorveterans.care/aidandattendance\" target=\"_blank\">Aid and Attendance Frequently Asked Questions for Veterans</a></td></tr><tr>\t<td class=\"footnote_plugin_index\"><span id=\"footnote_plugin_reference_8597_2\">[2]</span></td>\t<td class=\"footnote_plugin_link\"><span onclick=\"footnote_moveToAnchor('footnote_plugin_tooltip_8597_2');\">^</span></td>\t<td class=\"footnote_plugin_text\">Mayo Clinic: <a href=\"http://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/marriage-counseling/basics/definition/prc-20012741\" target=\"_blank\">Marriage counseling</a></td></tr>\t\t</tbody>\t</table></div><script type=\"text/javascript\">\tfunction footnote_expand_reference_container() {\t\tjQuery(\"#footnote_references_container\").show();        jQuery(\"#footnote_reference_container_collapse_button\").text(\"-\");\t}    function footnote_collapse_reference_container() {        jQuery(\"#footnote_references_container\").hide();        jQuery(\"#footnote_reference_container_collapse_button\").text(\"+\");    }\tfunction footnote_expand_collapse_reference_container() {\t\tif (jQuery(\"#footnote_references_container\").is(\":hidden\")) {            footnote_expand_reference_container();\t\t} else {            footnote_collapse_reference_container();\t\t}\t}    function footnote_moveToAnchor(p_str_TargetID) {        footnote_expand_reference_container();        var l_obj_Target = jQuery(\"#\" + p_str_TargetID);        if(l_obj_Target.length) {            jQuery('html, body').animate({                scrollTop: l_obj_Target.offset().top - window.innerHeight/2            }, 1000);        }    }</script><p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.lifehack.org/583603/how-couples-counseling-can-help-saving-your-relationship\">How Couples Counseling Can Help You Get Through Hard Times with Your Loved One</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.lifehack.org\">Lifehack</a>.</p>",

Admitting that your work is a nightmare means that you&rsquo;re ready (and hopefully willing) to take action to change your circumstances. As you&rsquo;ll see shortly, there are several solutions that can help bring your work life into a happier realm.</p>\n<p>Before we get started let me suggest that you put aside any preconceived notions of what you might do. Instead, keep your options open and wait until you are drawn to a solution that offers the best results for you.</p>\n<h2>I hate my job! Give me some solutions to fix this.</h2>\n<p>Fortunately there are a number of solutions to help you escape from your joyless work situation. We&rsquo;ll divide these solutions into two categories. The first one will cover solutions that help you stay in your current job but improve your circumstances. The second category will offer you solutions for quitting your job and moving to new pastures.</p>\n<h3><strong>You hate your job but due to financial burdens or lack of other job offers you&rsquo;re forced to stay where you are.</strong></h3>\n<p>Try these five solutions:</p>\n<p><strong>1. Be grateful for having a job.</strong></p>\n<p>However much you hate your job, just think of the millions of unemployed people who are desperate to find work. While your job may be far from perfect, it&rsquo;s still a job. It pays you a wage and offers you a chance to contribute to society.</p>\n<p><strong>2. Be honest with your boss.</strong></p>\n<p>It may be hard to discuss with your boss the reasons why you hate your job, but it can be worth it. When confronted with facts such as: &ldquo;My duties lack variety&rdquo; or &ldquo;I never get sent on training courses,&rdquo; many bosses will take note of these remarks. If they want to keep you then there is a good chance they will take action to make your working life more acceptable to you. If your problem is with your boss, still find a way to talk to him or her about the issues. Open, non-hostile dialogue can resolve most problems.</p>\n<p><strong>3. Inject fun into your work.</strong></p>\n<p>You may work on a factory line or as a data entry clerk in an office. On the surface these jobs might appear as dull as dishwater. However, if you go to work with an expectation of having fun, you&rsquo;ll be amazed by the results. Ways of adding fun to your work day include spending breaks with upbeat colleagues, singing at work, exchanging jokes with co-workers, and understanding that being professional does not mean you always need to be serious.</p>\n<p><strong>4. Customize your work space.</strong></p>\n<p>If your company is dragging you down and slowly drowning your hopes and dreams, you need to take immediate action. One of the best things to do is to take control of your personal working environment. For example, if you work in an office make sure your desk and drawers are clean and tidy. Then introduce some character and inspiration to your desk space by adding an ornate plant and/or adding a picture of a loved one. Small changes like these can make a big difference.</p>\n<p><strong>5. Take control through goal setting.</strong></p>\n<p>Goal setting is a powerful and proven technique for boosting results. Your employer is likely to have organizational goals, but there is nothing to stop you from creating your <em>own </em>goals as well. If you&rsquo;re on good terms with your boss, explain to him or her that you&rsquo;re planning on setting goals to help you develop your job and to benefit the organization. If you&rsquo;ve stopped speaking to your boss (it happens!), then you can still set goals that are within your control. For instance, you can decide to arrive early to work each morning to tackle the daily backlog of emails.</p>\n<h3><strong>You hate your job, and you need to quit <em>now</em>!</strong></h3>\n<p>Try these five solutions:</p>\n<p><strong>1. Take a vacation.</strong></p>\n<p>A vacation does not need to be an expensive trip to the Caribbean. Use any vacation time you may have saved up to give you breathing space to take stock of your life, and time and energy to focus on your future. It can be time off of work to spend job-hunting and going to interviews, or with friends and family who can give valuable advice. With time to think, you can decide if you really want to quit your job and if so, what your next steps will be.</p>\n<p><strong>2. Be prepared.</strong></p>\n<p>If you&rsquo;ve decided to definitely quit your job, it&rsquo;s best to be adequately prepared. This will mean either having sufficient savings to live on for a period of time or having another job to go to. Update your resume, give your present employer a decent notice period, and leave on the best terms possible.</p>\n<p><strong>3. Move sideways.</strong></p>\n<p>If your work problem is related to your manager or team members, you may not need to leave your current employer. Instead, you could choose to apply for other positions within your organization. A new manager and a new team could be just what you need to break free from the &ldquo;I hate my job!&rdquo; trap.</p>\n<p><strong>4. Turn your skills into a freelance career.</strong></p>\n<p>Do you love your work but hate your work environment? If so, you could be a good candidate for freelancing. Let&rsquo;s say that you work as a personal assistant. It&rsquo;s the role in which you&rsquo;ve always excelled, but right now you have an obnoxious boss. Why not take your skills to the marketplace and see if you can secure well-paid contract work? You could also consider offering your services as a &ldquo;virtual assistant.&rdquo;</p>\n<p><strong>5. Don&rsquo;t look back.</strong></p>\n<p>If you&rsquo;ve chosen to quit your job then <em>go for it</em>! Once you&rsquo;ve informed your employer, and agreed on an exit date, put the rest of your energy and focus on what you want to do next. Sometimes people decide to leave a job, but get emotionally caught up with worrying about things such as missing their colleagues and stressing over the future. Don&rsquo;t let this happen to you. Keep your eyes firmly on a brighter working future.</p>\n<p>A job that you dislike can make your life a living hell. The secret to freedom is to act. You must decide whether to quit your job or stay where you are. Whatever your decision, improve your situation. Any of the recommendations above is far better than doing nothing and wallowing in misery year after year. Hating your job can be just what you need to motivate you to a new and more successful life.

            "content": "<p><a href=\"https://stratechery.com/2017/apples-china-problem/\">Ben Thompson had a great column this week</a>, in the wake of Apple&#8217;s quarterly results and Microsoft&#8217;s announcement of the Surface Laptop:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Did you hear about the new Microsoft Surface Laptop? The <a href=\"https://twitter.com/reckless/status/859448810187235330\">usual\nsuspects</a> are claiming it\u2019s a MacBook competitor, which is\ntrue insomuch as it is a laptop. In truth, though, the Surface\nLaptop isn\u2019t a MacBook competitor at all for the rather obvious\nreason that it runs Windows, while the MacBook runs MacOS. This\nhas always been the foundation of Apple\u2019s business model:\n<a href=\"https://stratechery.com/2016/everything-as-a-service/\">hardware differentiated by software</a> such that said hardware\ncan be sold with a margin much greater than nominal competitors\nrunning a commodity operating system.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Hardware differentiated by <em>superior, exclusive</em> software is the key to understanding Apple. It&#8217;s the reason the company was founded. Apple II&#8217;s were the best personal computer hardware <em>and</em> had the best software. Part of why Woz is so venerated is that he was unimaginably gifted at both hardware <em>and</em> <a href=\"http://gizmodo.com/how-steve-wozniak-wrote-basic-for-the-original-apple-fr-1570573636\">software</a>. Hardware differentiated by software is how Apple survived in the late &#8217;90s, when the company was struggling. It explains all the company&#8217;s success after that: the iPod, the resurgence of the Mac, iPhone, iPad, and Apple Watch. Any comparison between Microsoft&#8217;s Surface Laptop and Apple&#8217;s MacBooks that doesn&#8217;t place heavy emphasis on the value of MacOS is vapid.</p>\n\n<p>Thompson then turns to Apple&#8217;s languishing iPhone sales in China:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>But that is not what is going on in most of the world: plenty of\nfolks &#8212; more than last year &#8212; are happy to buy the iPhone 7,\neven though it doesn\u2019t look much different than the iPhone 6.\nAfter all, if you need a new phone, and you want iOS, you don\u2019t\nhave much choice! Except, again, for China: that is the country\nwhere the appearance of the iPhone matters most; Apple\u2019s\nproblem, though, is that in China that is the only thing that\nmatters at all.</p>\n\n<p>The fundamental issue is this: unlike the rest of the world, in\nChina the most important layer of the smartphone stack is not the\nphone\u2019s operating system. Rather, it is WeChat. Connie Chan of\nAndreessen Horowitz <a href=\"http://a16z.com/2015/08/06/wechat-china-mobile-first/\">tried to explain in 2015</a> just how integrated\nWeChat is into the daily lives of nearly <a href=\"http://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/5d6Th5wndmJT25cRHemZNg\">900 million Chinese</a>, and\nthat integration has only grown since then: every aspect of a\ntypical Chinese person\u2019s life, not just online but also off is\nconducted through a single app (and, to the extent other apps are\nused, they are often games promoted through WeChat).</p>\n\n<p>There is nothing in any other country that is comparable: not\nLINE, not WhatsApp, not Facebook. All of those are about\ncommunication or wasting time: WeChat is that, but it is also for\nreading news, for hailing taxis, for paying for lunch (try and pay\nwith cash for lunch, and you\u2019ll look like a luddite), for\naccessing government resources, for business. For all intents and\npurposes WeChat is your phone, and to a far greater extent in\nChina than anywhere else, your phone is everything.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>As Thompson adds in a footnote, &#8220;Or, to put it another way, the operating system of China is WeChat, not iOS/Android.&#8221;</p>\n\n<p>Thompson cites a staggering statistic: among existing iPhone users in China who bought a new phone in 2016, only 50 percent of them bought another iPhone. That is an incredible statistical outlier compared to iPhone users in the rest of the world, where Apple&#8217;s retention rates hover around the mid-80s.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.businessinsider.com/iphone-users-abandon-loyalty-to-apple-2016-11\">Here&#8217;s a Business Insider report from November of last year</a>, with retention statistics from 2014 through 2016 from UBS analysts Steven Milunovich and Benjamin Wilson. Business Insider leads with the iPhone&#8217;s slowly declining retention rate globally, but the real story is halfway down the page, in <a href=\"http://static4.businessinsider.com/image/5818d4cbdd089533548b4991-1015/screen%20shot%202016-11-01%20at%2016.29.01.png\">this chart</a>.</p>\n\n<p>According to that research from UBS, iPhone retention rates hover in the mid-to-high 80s in the U.S., U.K., and Germany. In Japan they&#8217;re in the mid-70s, but holding roughly steady. China&#8217;s numbers have plummeted &#8212; and these numbers from UBS (in the mid-50s for Q4 2016) are in line with the 50 percent number in the Chinese survey Thompson cited.</p>\n\n<p>So here&#8217;s Apple&#8217;s China problem: Chinese iPhone users aren&#8217;t nearly as loyal to the iPhone platform as iPhone users elsewhere are. This is already hurting Apple financially. Apple&#8217;s Q2 2017 financial results (announced this week) were, overall, OK. But other than China, they were actually good. The drop in iPhone sales in China was so severe, and China is so big, that it singlehandedly turned a good quarter into a so-so quarter.</p>\n\n<p>I subtly disagree with Ben Thompson on one point. Thompson attributes the iPhone&#8217;s slide in China to two factors:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>The whole &#8220;the operating system of China is WeChat, not iOS/Android&#8221; thing.</li>\n<li>The staleness of the iPhone 7 form factor.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>Thompson knows Chinese culture well &#8212; he lives in Taipei, visits China often, and speaks Mandarin. My grasp of Chinese culture is rudimentary at best, and I&#8217;ve never traveled to Asia. So I defer to him on the point that the iPhone as a status symbol is more important in China than it is elsewhere.</p>\n\n<p>Thompson, though, I think places too much weight on the fact that at a glance, some models of the iPhone 7 are indistinguishable from the iPhone 6 and 6S. Thompson argues that this is more of a problem in status-conscious China than it is elsewhere &#8212; that in China, there are many people who forego an upgrade to an iPhone 7 because other people won&#8217;t be able to tell that it isn&#8217;t, say, a boring two-year-old iPhone 6. I just don&#8217;t buy that. For one thing, the black and especially jet black iPhone 7 models <em>are</em> instantly recognizable as the latest and greatest.</p>\n\n<p>But more importantly, I just think the whole &#8220;<em>if it doesn&#8217;t have an altogether new form factor, it&#8217;s boring</em>&#8221; thing is hogwash. <a href=\"http://daringfireball.net/2016/09/design_as_branding\">I wrote an entire column about this</a> when the iPhone 7 debuted, and won&#8217;t rehash the whole argument here. But I am convinced this viewpoint is mostly that of the tech and gadget obsessed.</p>\n\n<p>Again, I&#8217;ll concede that the status symbol aspect of a high-end smartphone may well be more important in China than anywhere else in the world. But even if I also concede that the iPhone 7&#8217;s mostly-like-the-iPhone-6 form factor is a problem for the Chinese market, if the iOS platform engendered the loyalty in China that it does elsewhere, the result would be Chinese iPhone owners waiting another year for the <em>next</em> iPhone. Instead, according to the market research cited above, half of the Chinese iPhone owners who bought a new phone in 2016 switched to an Android device. There are some fine looking Android phones at the high end of the market, but there are none that, based on form factor alone, would explain this. And none of them have anything close to the luxury brand prestige that Apple does.</p>\n\n<p>In Apple&#8217;s &#8220;hardware differentiated by software&#8221; formula, the software is more important than the hardware. That&#8217;s why gadget writers so often get Apple wrong: they&#8217;re focused solely on hardware &#8212; the object, not the experience of using the object. That&#8217;s also why the financial press so often gets Apple wrong: they focus only on the hardware because that&#8217;s where the money comes from.</p>\n\n<p>If forced to choose, I would much rather run iOS on a Google Pixel than Android on an iPhone 7. I would rather run MacOS on a ThinkPad than Windows on a MacBook Pro.<sup id=\"fnr1-2017-05-05\"><a href=\"#fn1-2017-05-05\">1</a></sup> Whenever I bring up this thought experiment &#8212; would you rather run Apple&#8217;s software platform on non-Apple hardware or run some other software platform on Apple hardware &#8212; I get email from readers who say they actually do choose Apple products, especially MacBooks, for the hardware. I believe them, but those are the sort of customers with the least loyalty to Apple. If all you depend on is, say, Chrome, a text editor, and a terminal, it&#8217;s easy to switch to another laptop brand. If you depend on native Mac and iOS apps, iCloud, and iMessage, it&#8217;s arduous, at best, to switch.</p>\n\n<p>If it really is true that &#8220;the operating system of China is WeChat, not iOS/Android&#8221;, that&#8217;s the whole ballgame right there. Again, my disagreement with Thompson here is subtle. He even describes WeChat&#8217;s centrality to the Chinese smartphone stack as &#8220;the fundamental issue&#8221;, leaving the supposed boringness of the iPhone 6S and 7 as a secondary issue. My difference with Thompson is that I don&#8217;t think the iPhone 6S/7 hardware is a problem at all. Personally, I think the iPhone 7 is such a great phone, and the 7 Plus in particular has such a great camera, that the quality of the latest iPhone hardware, including how it looks, shows just how much of a problem it is that WeChat, not iOS, is central to the iPhone experience in China.</p>\n\n<p>That&#8217;s a real problem for Apple, because even if Thompson is right (and I&#8217;m wrong) and Apple <em>does</em> have a boring-looking-hardware problem in China, they can (and seem poised to) remedy that by releasing exciting new iPhone hardware this year. But if the problem is that iOS engenders far less platform loyalty in China because of WeChat&#8217;s centrality &#8212; or even worse, if WeChat is central <em>and</em> better on Android than it is on iOS &#8212; there&#8217;s no easy fix for Apple.</p>\n\n<h2>Postscript</h2>\n\n<p>For those of you like me, who know very little about WeChat, this 2015 piece by Connie Chan (as linked to by Thompson) is a terrific introduction: &#8220;<a href=\"http://a16z.com/2015/08/06/wechat-china-mobile-first/\">When One App Rules Them All: The Case of WeChat and Mobile in China</a>&#8221;.</p>\n\n<div class=\"footnotes\">\n<hr />\n<ol>\n<li id=\"fn1-2017-05-05\">\n<p>I always use ThinkPads as my go-to example of high-quality PC hardware; perhaps I should start using Microsoft Surfaces?&nbsp;<a href=\"#fnr1-2017-05-05\"  class=\"footnoteBackLink\"  title=\"Jump back to footnote 1 in the text.\">&#x21A9;&#xFE0E;</a></p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n</div>",

That&#8217;s a fundamental aspect of Apple&#8217;s dual OS strategy. Microsoft only has one OS, Windows, so if they want to ship a laptop with the advantages of being restricted to software from an app store, they have to do it in a version of Windows.

But it\u2019s interesting to me that the premise of the tweet ignores the iPad, which has been completely locked to the App Store all along. I, for one, don\u2019t find it the least bit odd or surprising that Microsoft has shipped a version of Windows that\u2019s locked to their app store before Apple has done similarly with MacOS."

This bit about Windows 10 S caught my eye:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>The one thing to know, here, is that the Surface Laptop is the\nposter child for Windows 10 S, a new version of the operating\nsystem, also announced today, that Microsoft promises is more\nstreamlined, more secure, and that offers better performance and\nbattery life than the standard Windows 10.</p>\n\n<p>The tradeoff for those perks is that Windows 10 S doesn&#8217;t let you\ninstall any software that&#8217;s not from the Windows Store app market\n&#8212; which means that, at the very least, you won&#8217;t be able to\ninstall the Google Chrome web browser.</p>\n\n<p>If you&#8217;re not down with that, Microsoft lets you switch any\nWindows 10 S computer, including the Surface Laptop, to the\nregular Windows 10 Pro for a one-time $49 fee (less if you&#8217;re on a\ntablet or something else with a small screen size). But if you do\nthat, Microsoft says, it can no longer guarantee you&#8217;ll get the\nimproved battery life or higher performance.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I can see the argument for making the OS App-Store-only by default. I can also see the argument for an iOS-style system where it&#8217;s App-Store-only, period. But charging $50 for this feels like a shakedown. Imagine if Apple charged $50 to toggle the setting in the Security pane of System Prefs to allow the use of apps from outside the App Store.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a  title=\"Permanent link to \u2018Windows 10 &#8216;S&#8217; Is App-Store-Only Unless You Pay $50\u2019\"  href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2017/05/02/windows-10-s\">&nbsp;\u2605&nbsp;</a>\n</div>",

For most people, the luxury of living in a\nrelatively stable democracy is the luxury of not following\npolitics with a nerve-racked constancy. Trump does not afford\nthis. His Presidency has become the demoralizing daily obsession\nof anyone concerned with global security, the vitality of the\nnatural world, the national health, constitutionalism, civil\nrights, criminal justice, a free press, science, public education,\nand the distinction between fact and its opposite. The hundred-day\nmarker is never an entirely reliable indicator of a four-year\nterm, but it\u2019s worth remembering that Franklin Roosevelt and\nBarack Obama were among those who came to office at a moment of\nnational crisis and had the discipline, the preparation, and the\nrigor to set an entirely new course.

In that sense, it seems to me, we already live in a\ncountry with markedly less freedom than we did a month ago. It\u2019s\nless like living in a democracy than being a child trapped in a\nhouse where there is an abusive and unpredictable father, who will\nbrook no reason, respect no counter-argument, admit no error, and\nalways, always up the ante until catastrophe inevitably strikes.\nThis is what I mean by the idea that we are living through an\nemergency.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<div>\n<a  title=\"Permanent link to \u2018A Hundred Days of Trump\u2019\"  href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2017/05/01/remnick-trump\">&nbsp;\u2605&nbsp;</a>\n</div>",

Apple has never shared hard numbers on how many\nwearables it has sold, and doesn\u2019t even break out Watch sales in\nits quarterly earnings report. Instead, the device is bundled into\nApple\u2019s \u201cOther products,\u201d which the company says includes, \u201cApple\nTV, Apple Watch, Beats products, iPod and Apple-branded and\nthird-party accessories.\u201d</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>These articles come out like clockwork every 3 months, as Apple&#8217;s earnings report draws near. Apple told us they were not going to report hard numbers on Apple Watch right from the start, six months before it shipped. They want to keep them secret for competitive reasons.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Two years and two iterations after its launch, the Apple Watch has\nnot proven to be as indispensable as the iPhone, or even as\nlucrative as the Mac, the iPad, or Apple\u2019s services businesses.\nIt\u2019s unclear whether an iPhone-like overhaul, or attempts to\nmarket the watch directly to athletes or millennials, will\nultimately make a difference.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>(&#8220;Two years and two iterations after its launch&#8221; &#8212; I don&#8217;t know if that&#8217;s a mistake, if Murphy is counting WatchOS releases, or if he&#8217;s counting Series 1 as a full hardware iteration. But it&#8217;s sloppy writing. Most people would surely agree that there&#8217;s been only one iteration since launch, the Series 2 watches released last September.)</p>\n\n<p>The nut of every &#8220;Apple Watch is a dud&#8221; story is the fact that it&#8217;s clearly not an iPhone-size business. But that can&#8217;t be the only measure of success. The iPhone is the biggest and most successful consumer product in the history of the world. Nothing compares to the smartphone market, and it&#8217;s possible nothing else will in our lifetimes. You and I may never again see a product as profitable as the iPhone &#8212; not just from Apple, but from any company in any industry. Or maybe we will. It&#8217;s a complete unknown.</p>\n\n<p>But if Apple gets it into its head that they should only work on iPhone-sized opportunities, it would paralyze the company. In baseball terms, it&#8217;s fine for Apple to hit a bunch of singles while waiting for their next home run. According to Apple, <a href=\"https://www.wareable.com/apple/watch-sales-rolex-tim-cook-556\">they had more watch sales by revenue in 2015 than any company other than Rolex</a>, and Apple&#8217;s &#8220;Other&#8221; category, which is where Watch sales are accounted for, <a href=\"https://images.apple.com/pr/pdf/q1fy17datasum.pdf\">had a near record-breaking holiday quarter</a> three months ago, suggesting strongly that Watch sales were up over the year-ago holiday quarter.</p>\n\n<p>These two facts are both true: Apple Watch sales are a rounding error compared to the iPhone, and Apple Watch is a smash hit compared to traditional watches and other wearable devices.</p>",

            "content": "<p><a href=\"https://mobile.nytimes.com/2017/04/23/technology/travis-kalanick-pushes-uber-and-himself-to-the-precipice.html\">Mike Isaac&#8217;s profile of Uber CEO Travis Kalanick for The New York Times</a> contains an accusation that, on its face, sounds outrageous:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>For months, Mr. Kalanick had pulled a fast one on Apple by\ndirecting his employees to help camouflage the ride-hailing app\nfrom Apple\u2019s engineers. The reason? So Apple would not find out\nthat Uber had been secretly identifying and tagging iPhones even\nafter its app had been deleted and the devices erased &#8212; a fraud\ndetection maneuver that violated Apple\u2019s privacy guidelines.</p>\n\n<p>But Apple was on to the deception, and when Mr. Kalanick arrived\nat the midafternoon meeting sporting his favorite pair of bright\nred sneakers and hot-pink socks, Mr. Cook was prepared. \u201cSo, I\u2019ve\nheard you\u2019ve been breaking some of our rules,\u201d Mr. Cook said in\nhis calm, Southern tone. Stop the trickery, Mr. Cook then\ndemanded, or Uber\u2019s app would be kicked out of Apple\u2019s App Store.</p>\n\n<p>For Mr. Kalanick, the moment was fraught with tension. If Uber\u2019s\napp was yanked from the App Store, it would lose access to\nmillions of iPhone customers &#8212; essentially destroying the\nride-hailing company\u2019s business. So Mr. Kalanick acceded.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>&#8220;Secretly identifying and tagging iPhones even after its app had been deleted and the devices erased&#8221; is a rather startling accusation, because it sounds like it should be technically impossible. It&#8217;s also very much unclear what information Uber was able to glean from these &#8220;identified and tagged&#8221; iPhones other than some sort of unique device identifier. Unfortunately, the Times story is very short on details here. But note that the Times is <em>not</em> saying Uber was &#8220;tracking&#8221; these phones. A lot of people are jumping to the conclusion that Uber was somehow tracking the location of users even after they deleted the Uber app, but the word &#8220;track&#8221; only appears in the article in the context of Kalanick having &#8220;excelled at running track and playing football&#8221; in high school.</p>\n\n<p>[<strong>Update:</strong> This explains a lot, regarding the hubbub today over this story. <a href=\"http://newsdiffs.org/diff/1383350/1383404/https%3A/www.nytimes.com/2017/04/23/technology/travis-kalanick-pushes-uber-and-himself-to-the-precipice.html\">When first published, the Times story <em>did</em> use the word &#8220;tracking&#8221;</a>, but a subsequent revision changed that word to &#8220;identifying and tagging&#8221;.]</p>\n\n<p>Reading between the lines, it is possible &#8212; and my gut says quite probable &#8212; that Uber wasn&#8217;t <em>doing</em> anything on these iPhones other than when its app was installed and running on them. From the end of the article:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>The idea of fooling Apple, the main distributor of Uber\u2019s app,\nbegan in 2014.</p>\n\n<p>At the time, Uber was dealing with widespread account fraud in\nplaces like China, where tricksters bought stolen iPhones that\nwere erased of their memory and resold. Some Uber drivers there\nwould then create dozens of fake email addresses to sign up for\nnew Uber rider accounts attached to each phone, and request rides\nfrom those phones, which they would then accept. Since Uber was\nhanding out incentives to drivers to take more rides, the drivers\ncould earn more money this way.</p>\n\n<p>To halt the activity, Uber engineers assigned a persistent\nidentity to iPhones with a small piece of code, a practice called\n\u201cfingerprinting.\u201d Uber could then identify an iPhone and prevent\nitself from being fooled even after the device was erased of its\ncontents.</p>\n\n<p>There was one problem: Fingerprinting iPhones broke Apple\u2019s rules.\nMr. Cook believed that wiping an iPhone should ensure that no\ntrace of the owner\u2019s identity remained on the device.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>What Isaac is reporting here doesn&#8217;t require any code running on an iPhone other than when the Uber app is itself installed and launched. I&#8217;m speculating here, but it could be something like this:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><p>The Uber app, while installed, fingerprints the device somehow, and reports the fingerprint home to Uber&#8217;s servers, where it is tied to the user&#8217;s Uber account. (All iPhones have a Unique Device Identifier &#8212; &#8220;UDID&#8221; &#8212; but <a href=\"http://lifehacker.com/5898282/what-a-udid-is-and-why-apples-rejecting-apps-that-want-yours\">Apple banned third-party apps from accessing it in 2012</a>. Uber either found a way to access UDIDs surreptitiously, or created some other way of uniquely identifying devices even after they&#8217;ve been wiped. It would be good to know exactly what they did, but for the sake of my argument here it doesn&#8217;t matter.)</p></li>\n<li><p>The Uber app is deleted from the device and/or device is wiped. At this point, Uber knows the fingerprint for the device, but can\u2019t use it to track the device in any way, <em>and they don\u2019t care</em>, because until someone reinstalls the Uber app on the phone it isn&#8217;t being used to book fraudulent rides.</p></li>\n<li><p>The Uber app is reinstalled on the iPhone. When it launches, it does the fingerprint check and phones home again. Uber now knows this is the same iPhone they\u2019ve seen before, because the fingerprint matches. This is the violation of Apple&#8217;s privacy policy.</p></li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>But until step 3, when the Uber app is reinstalled, I don&#8217;t think Uber was &#8220;tracking&#8221; the phone in any way. And they didn\u2019t care \u2014 the Times says the whole project was designed to counter fraud in China, which required the Uber app to be reinstalled on stolen iPhones.</p>\n\n<p>Repeating from the opening of the article, Isaac wrote:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>So Apple would not find out that Uber had been secretly\nidentifying and tagging iPhones even after its app had been\ndeleted and the devices erased &#8212; a fraud detection maneuver that\nviolated Apple\u2019s privacy guidelines.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>That <em>sounds</em> like Uber was doing the identifying and &#8220;tagging&#8221; (whatever that is) after the app had been deleted and/or the device wiped, but I think what it might &#8212; <em>might</em> &#8212; actually mean is merely that the identification persisted after the app had been deleted and/or the device wiped. That&#8217;s not supposed to be technically possible &#8212; iOS APIs for things like the UDID and even the MAC address stopped reporting unique identifiers years ago, because they were being abused by privacy invasive ad trackers, analytics packages, and entitled shitbags like Uber. That&#8217;s wrong, and Apple was right to put an end to it, but it&#8217;s far less sensational than the prospect of Uber having been able to identify and &#8220;tag&#8221; an iPhone <em>after</em> the Uber app had been deleted. The latter scenario only seems technically possible if other third-party apps were executing surreptitious code that did this stuff through Uber&#8217;s SDK, or if the Uber app left behind malware outside the app&#8217;s sandbox. I don&#8217;t think that&#8217;s the case, if only because I don&#8217;t think Apple would have hesitated to remove Uber from the App Store if it was infecting iPhones with hidden phone-home malware.</p>\n\n<p>The article does raise some questions:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p>What APIs and device info was Uber using to identify iPhones? Are these API loopholes now closed in iOS? If we don&#8217;t learn exactly what Uber was using to identify devices, we cannot know that the technique no longer works. iOS users should be able to feel confident that when they delete an app, all connections between their device and the developer of the app are disconnected, and that when they wipe a device, everything personally identifying has been removed from it.</p></li>\n<li><p>What exactly did Apple know about Uber&#8217;s actions in this regard when Tim Cook called Kalanick in for the meeting? Was Apple aware that Uber was specifically keeping a database of unique iPhone identifiers? If so, how?</p></li>\n<li><p>What prompted Apple to investigate Uber in this regard? And why did Uber suspect Apple was going to investigate, prompting them to geofence their fingerprinting so it wouldn&#8217;t trigger in Cupertino? (My theory: the Uber app was calling private APIs, and they used the geofence to avoid calling those private APIs while the app was in App Store review, assuming, perhaps incorrectly, that all App Store reviewers work in Cupertino. App Store review can identify apps that call private APIs.)</p></li>\n<li><p><strong>Update</strong>: Why didn&#8217;t Apple require Uber to disclose what they\u2019d done as a condition for remaining in the store? Shouldn&#8217;t iPhone users who had Uber installed know about this?</p></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>[<strong>Update 2:</strong> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/chronic/status/856250223777206273\">Will Strafach examined a 2014 build of the Uber iOS app</a> and found them using private APIs to use IOKit to pull the device serial number from the device registry. There might be more, but this alone is a blatant violation of App Store policy. <a href=\"https://twitter.com/chronic/status/856333895050178560\">Strafach confirms</a> that the technique Uber was using no longer works in iOS 10.]</p>\n\n<hr />\n\n<p>The article also contains this non-Apple-related tidbit:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Uber devoted teams to so-called competitive intelligence,\npurchasing data from an analytics service called Slice\nIntelligence. Using an email digest service it owns named\nUnroll.me, Slice collected its customers\u2019 emailed Lyft receipts\nfrom their inboxes and sold the anonymized data to Uber. Uber used\nthe data as a proxy for the health of Lyft\u2019s business. (Lyft, too,\noperates a competitive intelligence team.)</p>\n\n<p>Slice confirmed that it sells anonymized data (meaning that\ncustomers\u2019 names are not attached) based on ride receipts from\nUber and Lyft, but declined to disclose who buys the information.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>This is, needless to say, super shitty. We expect it from Uber. But Slice should be ashamed of themselves. Their <a href=\"https://unroll.me/\">Unroll.me</a> service is billed as a tool to &#8220;Clean up your inbox&#8221; by identifying subscription emails and allowing you to unsubscribe from them in bulk. It&#8217;s &#8220;free&#8221; in the sense that you don&#8217;t pay them money, but they&#8217;re selling your personal information to companies like Uber. Supposedly that information is anonymized, but wiped iPhones are supposed to be anonymized too, and Uber found at least one route around that. </p>",

Trying to defeat the established\nsmartwatch players by playing their game won\u2019t work. Is there\nsomething in Swatch Group\u2019s culture that predisposes it to be\ncompetitive with Google and Apple software engineers?</p>\n\n<p>Just as Nokia should have embraced Android in 2010, riding on its\nproven combination of Design, Supply Chain, and Carrier\nDistribution prowess to keep a leading role in the smartphone\nrevolution, Swatch could use its native &#8212; but circumscribed &#8212;\ncultural and technical skills to create beautiful, fun\nsmartwatches \u2026 that run on Google\u2019s software. But just like\nNokia&#8217;s culture and success prevented it from seizing the Android\nmoment, similar factors will keep Swatch from being a powerful\nplayer in the smartwatch world.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I agree. <em>If</em> the Swatch Group wants to make smartwatches, they should almost certainly go with Android Wear, and they&#8217;re almost certainly doomed with their pre-announced homegrown OS. And it&#8217;s crazy that even if they succeed at creating their own OS, that they think it won&#8217;t need frequent updates and bug fixes. That&#8217;s not how computer platforms work, and make no mistake, smartwatches are computer platforms.</p>\n\n<p>But I think the Swiss watch industry would do well to stick to their mechanical guns. They should leave it to computerized gadgeteers to make smartwatches, and focus on making mechanical watches that stand the test of time (no pun intended). I love computers (duh), but I find mechanical watches to be a source of joy, a bulwark against the ever-encroaching computerization of everything.</p>\n\n<p>The bread and butter for high-end watch companies are aficionados who own multiple watches. Almost no one uses multiple smartwatches. People might have old ones in a drawer, but just as with with phones, it&#8217;s only convenient to have one smartwatch <em>in active use</em> at a time. Apple knows this: that&#8217;s why they made it so easy to swap straps &#8212; multiple looks for variety, but just one watch. For watch fans who actually do want multiple watches <em>and</em> a smartwatch, every watch other than their one smartwatch is likely to be a mechanical.</p>\n\n<p>I don&#8217;t think the Swiss watch industry has a chance of out-computer-engineering Apple. Instead they should focus on what they&#8217;ve always done: designing and making great mechanical watches &#8212; creating a breath of analog fresh air in an ever-more-digitized world.</p>",

No news organization, let alone one as prestigious in stature and as fastidious about style and usage as The New York Times, should <em>ever</em> describe Mar-a-Lago as &#8220;the Winter White House&#8221;. Prefacing it by &#8220;so-called&#8221; doesn&#8217;t make it right. So-called by whom? By Trump.</p>\n\n<p>There is only one White House. It is in Washington D.C., and it is owned by the U.S. federal government. It is sometimes and rightly called &#8220;The People&#8217;s House&#8221;, because we the people own it, and we vote to elect the president who lives and works in it. No one profits financially when a state visit is held at the White House.</p>\n\n<p>Mar-a-Lago is a private facility owned by Trump himself. When he hosts state visits there, not only does someone personally profit from it, that someone is Trump himself. Using Mar-a-Lago for official state business goes against everything that the actual White House stands for.</p>\n\n<p>This is no little thing. Describing Mar-a-Lago in a news article as &#8220;the so-called Winter White House&#8221; is normalizing out and out corruption &#8212; Trump&#8217;s shameless profiteering off the presidency.</p>\n\n<p>If the Times wants to quote Trump using the phrase, so be it. But the description should never be used in news copy. The New York Times has no more reason to describe Mar-a-Lago as &#8220;the Winter White House&#8221; than they do to refer to their own publication as &#8220;the failing New York Times&#8221;.</p>",

I have great news to share:</p>\n\n<p>Apple is currently hard at work on a &#8220;completely rethought&#8221; Mac Pro, with a modular design that can accommodate high-end CPUs and big honking hot-running GPUs, and which should make it easier for Apple to update with new components on a regular basis. They&#8217;re also working on Apple-branded pro displays to go with them.</p>\n\n<p>I also have not-so-great news:</p>\n\n<p>These next-gen Mac Pros and pro displays &#8220;will not ship this year&#8221;. (I hope that means &#8220;next year&#8221;, but all Apple said was &#8220;not this year&#8221;.) In the meantime, Apple is today releasing meager speed-bump updates to the existing Mac Pros. The $2999 model goes from 4 Xeon CPU cores to 6, and from dual AMD G300 GPUs to dual G500 GPUs. The $3999 model goes from 6 CPU cores to 8, and from dual D500 GPUs to dual <del>D800</del> D700 GPUs. Nothing else is changing, including the ports. No USB-C, no Thunderbolt 3 (and so no support for the LG UltraFine 5K display).</p>\n\n<p>But more good news, too:</p>\n\n<p>Apple has &#8220;great&#8221; new iMacs in the pipeline, slated for release &#8220;this year&#8221;, including configurations specifically targeted at large segments of the pro market.</p>\n\n<hr />\n\n<p>Let&#8217;s say you&#8217;re Apple. You&#8217;re faced with the following problem. Three years ago you launched a radical new lineup of Mac Pros. For multiple reasons, you haven&#8217;t shipped an update to those machines since. At some point you came to the conclusion that the 2013 Mac Pro concept was fundamentally flawed. It was tightly integrated internally, which allowed for some very nice features: it was small and beautiful (a pro machine that demanded placement <em>on</em> your desk, not <em>under</em> your desk) and it could run whisper quietly. But that tight integration made it hard to update regularly. The idea that expansion could be handled almost entirely by external Thunderbolt peripherals sounded good on paper, but hasn&#8217;t panned out in practice. And the GPU design was a bad prediction. Apple bet on a dual-GPU design (multiple smaller GPUs, with &#8220;pro&#8221;-level performance coming from parallel processing) but the industry has gone largely in the other direction (machines with one big GPU).</p>\n\n<p>And so you decided to completely redesign the Mac Pro. But that new design isn&#8217;t going to ship this year. You&#8217;re committed to your pro users, but a sizable chunk of them are growing ever more restless. They suspect &#8212; in some cases strongly &#8212; that you don&#8217;t care about them anymore. They see the stalled Mac Pro lineup as a sign that Apple no longer cares about them, and they worry deeply that the Mac Pro isn&#8217;t merely waiting for a major update but instead is waiting to be decommissioned.</p>\n\n<p>What do you do?</p>\n\n<p>There are really only two options at this point. The first would be to suck it up and wait until the next-generation Mac Pros are ready to be announced, and suffer in silence while more and more people point to the current Mac Pro&#8217;s stagnation as proof that Apple is abandoning the Mac Pro market.</p>\n\n<p>The second would be to bite the bullet and tell the world what your plans are, even though it&#8217;s your decades-long tradition &#8212; a fundamental part of the company&#8217;s culture &#8212; to let actual shipping products, not promises of future products, tell your story.</p>\n\n<p>Apple chose the latter.</p>\n\n<hr />\n\n<p>We&#8217;re inside a nondescript single-story office building on Apple&#8217;s extended old campus, across De Anza Boulevard from One Infinite Loop. This is Apple&#8217;s Product Realization Lab for Mac hardware, better known, internally, as &#8220;the machine lab&#8221;. This is where they make and refine prototypes for new Mac hardware. We don&#8217;t get to see anything cool. There is no moment where they lift a black cloth and show us prototypes of future hardware. The setting feels chosen simply to set the tone that innovative Mac hardware design &#8212; across the entire Mac lineup &#8212; is not a thing of the past.</p>\n\n<p>There are only nine people at the table. Phil Schiller, Craig Federighi, and John Ternus (vice president, hardware engineering &#8212; in charge of Mac hardware) are there to speak for Apple. Bill Evans from Apple PR is there to set the ground rules and run the clock. (We had 90 minutes.) The other five are writers who were invited for what was billed as &#8220;a small roundtable discussion about the Mac&#8221;: <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2017/04/04/apple-pushes-the-reset-button-on-the-mac-pro/\">Matthew Panzarino</a>, <a href=\"http://mashable.com/2017/04/04/apple-reveals-mac-pro-imac-plans/\">Lance Ulanoff</a>, <a href=\"https://www.axios.com/apple-to-ditch-the-current-mac-pro-design-but-replacement-wont-arrive--2343465726.html\">Ina Fried</a>, <a href=\"https://www.buzzfeed.com/johnpaczkowski/apple-says-it-is-completely-rethinking-the-mac-pro\">John Paczkowski</a>, and yours truly.</p>\n\n<p>The discussion is on the record.</p>\n\n<p>Here&#8217;s how Schiller broke the news on Mac Pro. It&#8217;s worth quoting him at length:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>With regards to the Mac Pro, we are in the process of what we call\n&#8220;completely rethinking the Mac Pro&#8221;. We&#8217;re working on it. We have\na team working hard on it right now, and we want to architect it\nso that we can keep it fresh with regular improvements, and we&#8217;re\ncommitted to making it our highest-end, high-throughput desktop\nsystem, designed for our demanding pro customers.</p>\n\n<p>As part of doing a new Mac Pro &#8212; it is, by definition, a\nmodular system &#8212; we will be doing a pro display as well. Now\nyou won&#8217;t see any of those products this year; we&#8217;re in the\nprocess of that. We think it&#8217;s really important to create\nsomething great for our pro customers who want a Mac Pro modular\nsystem, and that&#8217;ll take longer than this year to do.</p>\n\n<p>In the interim, we know there are a number of customers who\ncontinue to buy our [current Mac Pros]. To be clear, our current\nMac Pro has met the needs of some of our customers, and we know\nclearly not <em>all</em> of our customers. None of this is black and\nwhite, it&#8217;s a wide variety of customers. Some\u2026 it&#8217;s the kind of\nsystem they wanted; others, it was not.</p>\n\n<p>In the meantime, we&#8217;re going to update the configs to make it\nfaster and better for their dollar. This is not a new model, not a\nnew design, we&#8217;re just going to update the configs. We&#8217;re doing\nthat this week. We can give you the specifics on that.</p>\n\n<p>The CPUs, we&#8217;re moving them down the line. The GPUs, down the\nline, to get more performance per dollar for customers who DO need\nto continue to buy them on the interim until we get to a newly\narchitected system.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>In an ideal world, yes, these next-gen Mac Pros (and new displays) would be shipping soon. In fact, if we&#8217;re going to say <em>ideal</em>, they&#8217;d already be shipping. But make no mistake, this is very good news for anyone who cares about the Mac Pro. Those of us with an ear to the ground knew that there were no major changes to the Mac Pro shipping soon. That meant one of two things: next-gen Mac Pros were a ways off, or Apple was abandoning the Mac Pro market.</p>\n\n<p>Given that, this is very good news for serious Mac users. Even for serious Mac users who don&#8217;t buy Mac Pro hardware, this is good news because it&#8217;s a sign of Apple&#8217;s commitment to pro Mac <em>software</em>. There is no reason for Apple to commit itself to a new modular Mac Pro unless they&#8217;re also committed to what makes the Mac the Mac in software.</p>\n\n<p>Some stats and facts Apple shared with us during the discussion:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p>Apple&#8217;s research shows that 15 percent of all Mac users use at least one &#8220;pro&#8221; app frequently. These are apps for things like music creation, video editing, graphic design, and software development. Basically, apps that are performance intensive. An additional 15 percent of Mac users use pro apps less frequently but at least a few times per month. That 30 percent of the overall Mac user base is what Apple considers the &#8220;pro&#8221; market.</p></li>\n<li><p>Overall, the split between notebooks and desktops in Mac sales is roughly 80/20. (Personally, I&#8217;m a little surprised desktops account for even 20 percent of sales. I would have guessed 85/15, and wouldn&#8217;t have been surprised to hear 90/10.)</p></li>\n<li><p>Even among pro users, notebooks are by far the most popular Macs. In second place are iMacs. The Mac Pro is third. Apple declined to describe the Mac Pro&#8217;s share of all Mac sales any more specifically than &#8220;a single-digit percent&#8221;, but my gut feeling is that the single digit is a lot closer to 1 than it is to 9.</p></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>So: only 30 percent of Mac users are in what Apple considers the pro market. Most of those use MacBook Pros (or other MacBooks). Most of those who use desktops use iMacs. None of this is a surprise, really &#8212; and this is exactly why so many users who depend on the Mac Pro have been deeply concerned about its future. For Apple to care about the Mac Pro, it requires Apple to care about a small number of users.</p>\n\n<p>Regarding iMacs, Schiller also said that new iMacs are in the works, slated for release some time this year (no specifics other than &#8220;this year&#8221;), including &#8220;configurations of iMac specifically with the pro customer in mind and acknowledging that our most popular desktop with pros is an iMac.&#8221;</p>\n\n<p>Craig Federighi then jumped in, and said:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>That is a pretty incredible evolution that we&#8217;ve seen over the\nlast decade. The original iMac, you never would&#8217;ve thought as\n<em>remotely</em> touching pro uses. And now you look at today&#8217;s 5K iMac,\ntop configs, it&#8217;s incredibly powerful, and a huge fraction of what\nwould&#8217;ve traditionally &#8212; whether it&#8217;s audio editing, video\nediting, graphics, arts and so forth &#8212; that would&#8217;ve previously\nabsolutely required the Mac Pros of old, are being well-addressed\nby iMac. But there&#8217;s still even further we can take iMac as a high\nperformance, pro system, and we think that form factor can address\neven more of the pro market.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>What struck me about this is that Apple was framing a discussion in which the big news &#8212; the whole point, really &#8212; was their pre-announcing a &#8220;completely rethought&#8221; next-generation Mac Pro by emphasizing that most of their pro users use MacBooks and most of the rest use iMacs &#8212; and that they have big plans in store for the pro segment of both of those product lines. It&#8217;s exactly what I would have expected Apple to say if they were breaking the news that the Mac Pro was going away: <em>We&#8217;re dropping the Mac Pro because its time has come and gone &#8212; all but a small percentage of our pro users have their needs met by MacBook Pros and high-end iMacs.</em></p>\n\n<p>So it might seem curious for Apple to frame the need for an all-new Mac Pro by emphasizing just how many of their pro users don&#8217;t need a Mac Pro. But if you think about it in the context of the current Mac Pro, it makes sense. Those whose needs <em>aren&#8217;t</em> met by MacBook Pros or iMacs are people who need extreme performance. The current Mac Pro &#8212; even putting aside the age of its components &#8212; only met the needs of <em>some</em> of those users. For the rest &#8212; for those who need the fastest Intel CPUs on the market, the biggest and most powerful GPUs, etc. &#8212; the current Mac Pro isn&#8217;t a good fit.</p>\n\n<p>There were several questions from a few of us trying to peg down <em>when</em> Apple realized it needed to start over and design a new Mac Pro. Apple, unsurprisingly, wouldn&#8217;t budge. But they were forthcoming about the fact that the current Mac Pro isn&#8217;t meeting the needs of all the users who need a Mac Pro. Federighi:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>I think we designed ourselves into a bit of a thermal corner, if\nyou will. We designed a system with the kind of\nGPUs that at the time we thought we needed, and that we thought we\ncould well serve with a two GPU architecture. That that was the\nthermal limit we needed, or the thermal capacity we needed. But\nworkloads didn&#8217;t materialize to fit that as broadly as we hoped.</p>\n\n<p>Being able to put larger single GPUs required a different system\narchitecture and more thermal capacity than that system was\ndesigned to accommodate. So it became fairly difficult to adjust.\nAt the same time, so many of our customers were moving to iMac\nthat we saw a path to address many, many more of those that were\nfinding themselves limited by a Mac Pro through next generation\niMac. And really put a lot of our energy behind that.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Schiller:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>As we&#8217;ve said, we made something bold that we thought would be\ngreat for the majority of our Mac Pro users. And what we\ndiscovered was that it was great for some and not others. Enough\nso that we need to take another path. One of the good things,\nhopefully, with Apple through the years has been a willingness to\nsay when something isn&#8217;t quite what we wanted it to be, didn&#8217;t\nlive up to expectations, to not be afraid to admit it and look for\nthe next answer.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The word &#8220;mistake&#8221; was not uttered, but this is about as close as we&#8217;re going to get to Apple admitting they miscalculated with the current Mac Pro&#8217;s concept. One word that was uttered, however, was &#8220;sorry&#8221;. Here&#8217;s Schiller, after being asked whether they already had an external design in mind for the next-gen Mac Pros:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>We\u2019re not going to get into exactly what stage we\u2019re in, just that\nwe told the team to take the time to do something really great. To\ndo something that can be supported for a long time with customers\nwith updates and upgrades throughout the years. We\u2019ll take the\ntime it takes to do that. The current Mac Pro, as we\u2019ve said a few\ntimes, was constrained thermally and it restricted our ability to\nupgrade it. And for that, we\u2019re sorry to disappoint customers who\nwanted that, and we\u2019ve asked the team to go and re-architect and\ndesign something great for the future that those Mac Pro customers\nwho want more expandability, more upgradability in the future.\nIt\u2019ll meet more of those needs.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<hr />\n\n<p>My takeaway is that the Mac&#8217;s future is bright. Mac sales were up in 2016, once again outpacing the PC industry as a whole, and the new MacBook Pros are a hit, with sales up &#8220;about 20 percent&#8221; year over year. The Mac is a $25 billion business for Apple annually, and according to the company there are 100 million people in the active Mac user base worldwide.</p>\n\n<p>Yes, those numbers are all peanuts compared to the iPhone, but <em>everything</em> is peanuts compared to the iPhone.</p>\n\n<p>Ternus put it plainly: &#8220;Some of our most talented folks are working on [the Mac]. I mean, quite frankly, a lot of this company, if not most of this company, runs on Macs. This is a company full of pro Mac users.&#8221;</p>\n\n<p>I asked whether Apple is aware of just how many serious Mac users have begun to doubt the company&#8217;s commitment to the Mac in general, and the needs of pro Mac users in particular. Schiller said:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>It\u2019s a reasonable question, and this is why we\u2019re here today,\nspecifically, to address that question above all else. We\u2019re\ncommitted to the Mac, we&#8217;ve got great talent on the Mac, both\nhardware and software, we\u2019ve got great products planned for the\nfuture, and as far as our horizon line can see, the Mac is a core\ncomponent of the things Apple delivers, including to our pro\ncustomers.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I think it was simply untenable for Apple to continue to remain silent on the Mac Pro front. No matter how disappointing you consider today&#8217;s speed bump updates to the lineup, they&#8217;re certainly better than no updates at all. But there was no way Apple could release today&#8217;s speed bumps without acknowledging that in and of themselves, these updates do not suggest that Apple is committed to the Mac Pro. In fact, if they had released these speed bumps without any comment about the future of the Mac Pro, people would have reasonably concluded that Apple had lost its goddamned mind.</p>\n\n<p>Ultimately, actions speak louder than words. But I very much like the words I heard yesterday.</p>\n\n<hr />\n\n<p>A few other miscellaneous tidbits from the discussion:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p>Near the end, John Paczkowski had the presence of mind to ask about the Mac Mini, which hadn&#8217;t been mentioned at all until that point. Schiller: &#8220;On that I&#8217;ll say the Mac Mini is an important product in our lineup and we weren&#8217;t bringing it up because it&#8217;s more of a mix of consumer with <em>some</em> pro use. &#8230; The Mac Mini remains a product in our lineup, but nothing more to say about it today.&#8221;</p></li>\n<li><p>Schiller, on Apple&#8217;s own pro apps: &#8220;I just want to reiterate our strong commitment there, as well. Both with Final Cut Pro X and Logic Pro X, there are teams on those software products that are completely dedicated to delivering great pro software to our customers. No foot off the gas there.&#8221;</p></li>\n<li><p>Federighi: &#8220;I think if you use Xcode downloads as a metric, it&#8217;s possible software developers are actually our largest pro audience. It&#8217;s growing very quickly, it&#8217;s been fantastic.&#8221;</p></li>\n<li><p>Asked whether coming-in-the-future next-gen Mac Pros would be assembled in the U.S. as the current ones are, Schiller said &#8220;We&#8217;re not ready to talk about that yet. Further down the line, we&#8217;d be happy to.&#8221;</p></li>\n<li><p>For examples of the type of software that the current Mac Pro isn&#8217;t well-suited for, Federighi mentioned VR: &#8220;Those can be in VR, those can be in certain kinds of high end cinema production tasks where most of the software out there that\u2019s been written to target those doesn\u2019t know how to balance itself well across multiple GPUs, but can scale across a single large GPU.&#8221;</p></li>\n<li><p>I asked about scripting and automation &#8212; whether Apple still sees scripting and automation as an important part of the pro market. Federighi: &#8220;We think scriptability and automation of the system remain super important.&#8221;</p></li>\n</ul>",
